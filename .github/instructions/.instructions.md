# App Modernization Progress

> **🤖 AI AGENT PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS**  
> This project enforces **ZERO backward compatibility** and **ZERO legacy code patterns**.  
> Every change must align with modernization goals and preserve system-wide consistency.

## 🔴 CRITICAL BEHAVIOR GUIDELINES

1. **📚 VUEPRESS IS REFERENCE, NOT A LOG**  
    - VuePress is for canonical, durable knowledge: how the system works.  
    - Update VuePress when architecture, contracts, or runbooks change.  
    - Do NOT add log-like notes (e.g., "fixed X" pages or per-PR updates).  
    - Preferred content:  
       - Architecture and data flows, state machines  
       - New/changed socket events (name, contract, lifecycle)  
       - New/changed API endpoints (request/response, errors, examples)  
       - New/changed shared types and Zod schemas (with examples)  
       - Operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides  
    - Ephemeral updates (bug fixes without contract/behavior change) belong in:  
       - PR descriptions and commit messages  
       - The `notes/` area when investigation context is useful  

2. **🗂️ PHASE-BASED EXECUTION**  
   - Work in *narrow, well-defined phases*.  
   - Each phase must have clear exit criteria.  
   - If you cannot complete a phase cleanly, stop and rescope before continuing.  

3. **🎯 ALIGN WITH MODERNIZATION GOALS**  
   - Always check whether the task contributes directly to modernization.  
   - If not, pause and revise.  

4. **✅ TEST AND VALIDATE EVERYTHING**  
   - For every change, provide test steps or add/extend tests.  
   - Run TypeScript checks (`npm run type-check`).  
   - Only run `npm run build` when changes are complete and validated.  

5. **📚 UPDATE VUEPRESS DOCS (WHEN CANONICAL KNOWLEDGE CHANGES)**  
   - Keep reference docs synchronized with the codebase.  
   - Update existing pages rather than creating ad-hoc "fix" pages.  
   - Document only canonical subjects: APIs, socket events, components, shared types, invariants, and runbooks.  
   - When shared types change, update the canonical type page, the Zod schema, and examples.  

6. **🧪 STRICT TDD WORKFLOW (Bugs & Enhancements)**  
   - **Step 1**: Write a Jest test (or extend one) that **fails** and reproduces the issue.  
   - **Step 2**: Show test code, file path, and the command to run it.  
   - **Step 3**: Stop. Do not modify app code until the failing test is confirmed.  
   - **Step 4**: Once confirmed, fix the app code.  
   - **Step 5**: Re-run the test. Confirm it now passes.  

   **Mandatory STOP Rule**:  
   - If you cannot create a failing test, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and explain why.  
   - No code modifications are allowed in this case.  

7. **🔍 FINAL VALIDATION**  
   - Run TS checks and all tests.  
   - Verify expected vs actual behavior.  
   - Ensure references to removed/changed types are fully updated.

## ⚠️ ZERO TOLERANCE RULES

8. **🚫 NO migration layers or compatibility functions** — rewrite cleanly.  
9. **🔄 CONSISTENT naming** across backend, frontend, DB, and sockets.  
10. **📦 USE shared types (`shared/`)** for all contracts/events.  
11. **🧪 VALIDATE with Zod** — no unchecked data.  
12. **📖 READ BEFORE YOU WRITE** — check docs and code before adding new patterns.  
13. **🔍 FIX ROOT CAUSES** — no patching inconsistencies.  
14. **♻️ REMOVE redundant interfaces** — use canonical types only.  
15. **❌ REMOVE legacy compatibility fields** from shared types.  
16. **🎯 USE canonical shared types directly in components** — no wrapping/mapping.  
17. **🧩 USE existing components** from the shared library, extend if missing.  
18. **🎨 Use `globals.css`** for global colors and styles — no hardcoded values.  
19. **DON’T GUESS — VERIFY**  
    - Always check canonical types, names, and schemas before coding.  
    - Never introduce guessed or ad-hoc names.

## ⚙️ FILES & STRUCTURE

- `scripts/` → automation tools (codemods, migrations, etc.)  
- `notes/` → optional scratch space for investigations and ephemeral logs (do not mirror into VuePress)  

*(Global planning files like `plan.md` are no longer required — use AI internal todos instead.)*  

---

## 🧠 AI OPERATIONAL RULES

- ✅ **Manual edits are the default.**  
  - For multi-file or complex changes, perform direct edits.  
  - Scripts are optional only for trivial, mechanical codemods.  
- 🔍 Always analyze existing patterns before introducing new code.  
- 🛑 If unsure about alignment with goals → STOP, re-check context, and ask.  

### VuePress contribution checklist (must pass ALL)
- Does this change update canonical knowledge (architecture, contracts, shared types, runbooks)?  
- If it’s a bug fix: did behavior or contracts change? If no, DO NOT add a VuePress page.  
- Are you updating an existing page instead of creating a new log-like page?  
- Are examples and Zod schemas updated where relevant?
