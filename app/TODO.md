    - [x] Created proper GameTemplate schema with full field validation (no `z.any()` shortcuts) ‚úÖ
    - [x] Created proper LeaderboardEntry schema with correct field mapping ‚úÖ
    - [x] Imported and used existing Question schema for proper validation ‚úÖ
    - [x] Fixed systematic field name consistency: `nom`‚Üí`name`, `niveaux`‚Üí`gradeLevel`, `questions_ids`‚Üí`questionIds` ‚úÖ
    - [x] Updated all frontend components to use canonical shared type field names ‚úÖ
    - [x] Aligned local schemas with shared types (removed mapping layers) ‚úÖ
    - [x] Fixed null value handling in filter responses ‚úÖ
  - [x] Remove all local/duplicated API type definitions after migration complete ‚úÖ

### Frontend API Migration Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED 

**All frontend TypeScript compilation errors resolved through systematic approach:**
- **Started with**: 65+ TypeScript error lines across 11 files
- **Achieved**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- **Method**: Proper schema creation (no legacy code, no patches, no shortcuts)
- **Result**: Clean, maintainable codebase with full type safety and runtime validation

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Proper runtime validation schemas with full field validation
- Systematic field name consistency across all frontend components  
- Eliminated all `z.any()` shortcuts in favor of proper schema definitions
- Frontend components now use canonical shared types exclusively
- No legacy compatibility layers or temporary patches

#### 1.2.3 Miscellaneous
- Do an audit of shared/ types and refactor if necessary to ensure all API and socket payloads use shared types with strict validation.
- Do a full sweep of frontend/backend to ensure that shared types are used everywhere they can, that no duplicate types exist, and that all types are strictly validated.

**important:** ask user to validate main types, especially looking at optional fields : should we make them mandatory or keep them optional? For sure, some are marked as optional but should be mandatory. This will reduce edge cases and improve not only type safety but also reduce bugs and improve overall code quality.

## 2. **Core Functional Testing & Bugfixes**

**Use jest** for unit tests: find bugs using the app, then write tests to fix them.

### 2.1. Practice Mode
- [ ] Thoroughly test practice mode (all flows: start, answer, finish, feedback).
- [ ] Fix any bugs or missing features found during testing.
- [ ] Ensure all socket and API payloads in practice mode use shared types and strict validation.

### 2.2. Live Tournaments
- [ ] Test live tournaments end-to-end (joining, answering, scoring, leaderboard).
- [ ] Specifically verify score calculations and leaderboard updates.
- [ ] Ensure all tournament-related payloads use shared types and strict validation.

### 2.3. Teacher's Dashboard (Time Control & Question Selection)
- [ ] Audit and refactor all dashboard socket/API payloads for strict typing and naming (shared types only).
- [ ] Fix issues with timer control, question selection, and state sync.
- [ ] Remove or refactor legacy code that causes type mismatches or state bugs.
- [ ] Add/Update runtime validation (e.g., Zod) for all dashboard payloads.

### 2.4. Projection Page
- [ ] Audit and refactor projection page for strict naming and typing (shared types only).
- [ ] Remove or update legacy code to match current backend/frontend contracts.
- [ ] Ensure all socket/API payloads are validated and type-safe.

---

## 3. **Legacy Code Cleanup**
- [ ] Identify and refactor/remove legacy code in all modules, prioritizing dashboard and projection.
- [ ] Ensure all code follows naming and typing conventions from `/instructions.md`.

---

## 4. **Testing & Documentation**
- [ ] Manual E2E test of all modes (practice, tournament, dashboard, projection).
- [ ] Add/Update automated tests for critical flows and edge cases.
- [ ] Run full TypeScript check (`npx tsc`) and lint.
- [ ] Update README and developer docs to reflect new type safety and contracts.
- [ ] Document any new shared types or validation schemas.

---

## 5. **Technical Debt & Quality Audits (Track & Schedule After Launch)**

### 5.1. API Request Type Safety Audit
- [ ] Ensure all API request bodies, query params, and path params are strongly typed and validated (with shared types and runtime validation).

### 5.2. Authorization & Authentication Audit
- [ ] Review all endpoints and socket events for proper auth checks and role enforcement.

### 5.3. Error Handling Consistency Audit
- [ ] Ensure all errors (API and socket) use shared error types and consistent error codes/messages.

### 5.4. Environment Variable & Secrets Audit
- [ ] Check that all secrets and sensitive config are loaded from environment variables and never hardcoded.

### 5.5. Input Sanitization & Security Audit
- [ ] Review all user input points for XSS, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities.

### 5.6. Logging & Monitoring Audit
- [ ] Ensure all critical actions, errors, and warnings are logged (never log sensitive data).

### 5.7. Dependency & Package Audit
- [ ] Check for outdated, vulnerable, or unused dependencies.

### 5.8. Testing Coverage Audit
- [ ] Review unit, integration, and E2E test coverage.

### 5.9. Documentation Audit
- [ ] Ensure all APIs, sockets, and shared types are documented.

### 5.10. Performance & Scalability Audit
- [ ] Profile API and socket endpoints for bottlenecks and unnecessary data transfer.
