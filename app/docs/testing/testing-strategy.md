# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the overall testing approach for MathQuest, including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) testing.

## 1. Testing Philosophy
- Prioritize automated tests for all critical logic and user flows.
- Use code-driven, maintainable tests with clear assertions.
- Aim for high coverage, but focus on meaningful tests over 100% coverage.

## 2. Unit Testing
- Use Jest for both frontend and backend unit tests.
- Test pure functions, services, and React components in isolation.
- Mock dependencies and external services.

## 3. Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints and database interactions in the backend.
- Use supertest or similar tools for HTTP API tests.
- Use in-memory or test databases for isolation.

## 4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- Use Playwright for E2E browser tests.
- Cover major user journeys (login, game flow, quiz, etc.).
- Run E2E tests against a staging or test environment.

## 5. Test Data Management
- Use seed scripts or fixtures for consistent test data.
- Clean up test data after each run.

## 6. Continuous Integration
- Run all tests on every pull request (CI pipeline).
- Block merges on test failures.

## 7. Coverage & Reporting
- Collect and review code coverage reports.
- Address untested critical paths.
