## 1. Introduction

MathQuestâ€™s frontend is built with **Next.js** (App Router), **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Socket.IO** for real-time features. The codebase is modular, with clear separation between quiz, tournament, shared UI, and socket logic.

## 2. Architecture Overview
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, SSR/SSG, API routes)
- **UI:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui, custom components
- **Real-Time:** Socket.IO Client for live quizzes/tournaments
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript, shared types with backend
- **State:** React Context, hooks, local state, localStorage

## 3. Key Folders & Files
- `src/app/` â€“ Next.js pages and routing logic
- `src/components/` â€“ Reusable UI
- `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom hooks for socket logic
- `src/types/` â€“ TypeScript types
- `src/utils.ts` â€“ Utility functions
- `public/` â€“ Static assets

## 4. State Management
- **Global:** React Context (Auth, user identity, etc.)
- **Local:** React hooks for component state
- **Custom:** Hooks encapsulate socket logic and timer state
- **Persistence:** localStorage for user/session info

## 5. Real-Time & Data Flow
- **Socket.IO** connects to backend for:
  - Quiz/tournament state sync
  - Real-time question/answer/timer events
  - Live participant and leaderboard updates
- **Hooks** abstract socket logic for both teacher and projection views
