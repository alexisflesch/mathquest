# Frontend Update TODO – Reconnecting to New Backend

The backend has been completely rewritten. The frontend must be updated to reconnect and interoperate with the new backend, using the new API payloads, socket event names, and strict typing conventions. This document tracks the required tasks and progress.

### 🚨 Key Discovery: Live Tournament Page Already Migrated
During analysis, discovered that the Live Tournament Page (`/app/live/[code]/page.tsx`) has **already been migrated** to use the new backend socket events:
- ✅ Uses `join_tournament` with correct payload (`accessCode`, `userId`, `username`, `avatarUrl`)
- ✅ Uses `game_question` event (not legacy `live_question`)
- ✅ Uses `timer_update`, `game_update`, `timer_set` events with new payload structures

- ✅ Includes comprehensive error handling and reconnection logic
- ✅ All socket integration tests passing (21 frontend + 18 backend tests)

**Status**: The main Live Tournament Page migration is **COMPLETE** ✅

### 🚨 Key Integration Notes Discovered
- Backend uses `gameId` parameters instead of `quizId` in many contexts
- New room naming: `projector_${gameId}`, `game_${accessCode}`, `lobby_${code}`
- Authentication flow changed to use `join_dashboard` events with `userId`
- Event payload structures significantly different from legacy system
- Backend requires `accessCode` instead of tournament codes in many flows

## Backend API Integration TODO: Replace Prisma with Backend Calls

The following API routes had direct Prisma usage removed. Each now contains a placeholder response and a TODO comment. These must be updated to call the real backend API endpoints, using only shared types for request/response payloads.

| API Route File | Previous: Used Prisma | Now: Needs Backend Call |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `/src/app/api/questions/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/questions/filters/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/questions/themes/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/tournament-questions/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/questions/count/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/questions/disciplines/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/enseignant/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/joueur/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/quiz/[quizId]/tournament-code/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/quiz/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/teacher/profile/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/teacher/quiz/[quizId]/questions/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/tournament-status/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/student/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/my-tournaments/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/auth/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/tournament-leaderboard/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/tournament/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/tournaments/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/tournament/status/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |
| `/src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts` | Yes | Yes |

**Action Required:**
- For each route above, implement a call to the backend API endpoint (see TODO in each file).
- Ensure all request/response types use only shared types (no direct Prisma types).
- Remove placeholder responses once backend integration is complete.

## Detailed Analysis: Live Tournament Page Migration Status

### Summary: **ALREADY COMPLETE** ✅

During comprehensive analysis of `/app/live/[code]/page.tsx`, discovered that the socket integration migration was **already completed** and working correctly. Here's what was found:

### ✅ Correctly Implemented Socket Events:
1. **Connection & Authentication**: Uses `join_tournament` with proper payload:
   ```typescript
   s.emit("join_tournament", { accessCode: code, userId, username, avatarUrl });
   ```

2. **Game Question Handling**: Uses `game_question` event (not legacy `live_question`):
   ```typescript
   s.on("game_question", (payload: TournamentQuestion) => { ... });
   ```

3. **Timer Management**: Uses new backend timer events:
   ```typescript
   s.on("timer_update", (data) => { ... });     // Server timer updates
   s.on("game_update", (data) => { ... });      // Game state changes  
   s.on("timer_set", ({ timeLeft, questionState }) => { ... }); // Timer control
   ```

4. **Answer Submission**: Uses correct `submit_answer` event:
   ```typescript
   socket.emit("submit_answer", {
     accessCode: tournamentCode,
     userId,
     questionId: currentQuestion.question.uid,
     answers: answersToSubmit,
     timeTaken: timeUsed
   });
   ```

5. **Game End Handling**: Properly handles `game_ended` event:
   ```typescript
   s.on("game_ended", (data) => {
     // Redirects to leaderboard with proper URL structure
   });
   ```

### ✅ Advanced Features Working:
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with `game_error` events
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection with proper state restoration
- **Dev Mode**: Built-in development/testing mode for isolated testing
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly timer and question display
- **Answer Feedback**: Visual feedback system for correct/incorrect answers
- **State Synchronization**: Proper pause/resume/stop state management

### ✅ Testing Status:
- **Frontend Tests**: 21/21 tests passing across 6 test suites
- **Backend Tests**: 18/18 tests passing across 3 integration test suites
- **Socket Communication**: Verified end-to-end socket event flow
- **Development Servers**: Both frontend (port 3008) and backend running successfully

### Key Architecture Features:
- Uses centralized `SOCKET_CONFIG` for connection management
- Implements proper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks
- Uses refs for timer management to avoid stale closures
- Handles both real-time and differed (asynchronous) tournament modes
- Includes comprehensive logging for debugging

### No Migration Needed ✅
The Live Tournament Page is **fully compatible** with the new backend and requires **no additional migration work**.

## Detailed Analysis: Lobby Page Migration Status

### Summary: **COMPLETED** ✅

The lobby page socket integration has been successfully updated to work with the new backend API. All socket events now use the correct payload structures and event names.

### ✅ Updated Socket Events:

1. **Lobby Join**: Updated payload structure:
   ```typescript
   // OLD: { code, username, avatar, cookie_id }
   // NEW: { accessCode, userId, username, avatarUrl }
   socket.emit("join_lobby", {
     accessCode: code,
     userId,
     username: identity.username,
     avatarUrl: identity.avatar,
   });
   ```

2. **Participant Management**: Updated to use `accessCode`:
   ```typescript
   socket.emit("get_participants", { accessCode: code });
   socket.emit("leave_lobby", { accessCode: code });
   ```

3. **Tournament Start**: Updated to use `accessCode`:
   ```typescript
   // OLD: { code }
   // NEW: { accessCode }
   socket.emit("start_tournament", { accessCode: code });
   ```

4. **New Backend Events**: Added support for new backend events:
   ```typescript
   socket.on("redirect_to_game", ({ accessCode, gameId }) => { ... });
   socket.on("game_started", ({ accessCode, gameId }) => { ... });
   ```

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Updated for structured error format:
   ```typescript
   // OLD: string error messages
   // NEW: structured error objects
   socket.on("lobby_error", ({ error, message }) => { ... });
   ```

### ✅ Backend Compatibility Verified:
- **Backend Tests**: 5/5 lobby integration tests passing
- **Event Payload Structure**: All events use correct `accessCode`, `userId`, `avatarUrl` fields
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with `error` and `message` fields
- **Reconnection Logic**: Updated to use new payload format on reconnect

### ✅ Backward Compatibility Maintained:
- Legacy event listeners maintained during transition period
- Graceful handling of both old and new event formats
- Comprehensive logging for debugging during migration

### Key Features Working:
- **Participant Management**: Real-time join/leave notifications
- **Tournament Creation**: Creator detection and start button functionality  
- **Redirect Handling**: Proper redirection to game/leaderboard pages
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and fallback navigation
- **Share Functionality**: Tournament code sharing with Web Share API
- **Authentication**: Identity verification and redirect for unauthorized users

### Migration Complete ✅
The Lobby Page is now **fully compatible** with the new backend and requires **no additional migration work**.
