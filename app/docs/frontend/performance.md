# MathQuest Frontend Performance

This document outlines performance optimization strategies for the MathQuest frontend.

## Key Strategies
- Use React.memo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Code-split pages and components with dynamic imports.
- Optimize images and assets.
- Minimize bundle size with tree-shaking and dependency analysis.
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Profile and monitor with React DevTools and browser performance tools.

## Example
```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const Leaderboard = dynamic(() => import('./Leaderboard'));
```
