# New Scoring Strategy Implementation

**Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Location:** `backend/src/core/services/scoringService.ts`

## Overview

The MathQuest scoring system has been completely rewritten to implement a balanced, fair, and scalable scoring strategy. The new system addresses three key requirements:

1. **Game Scaling:** Total points for any game scale to exactly 1000 points
2. **Balanced Multiple Choice Scoring:** Rewards precision and discourages random guessing
3. **Logarithmic Time Penalty:** Fair time-based penalty that doesn't harshly punish minor delays

## 🎯 Game Scaling to 1000 Points

### Problem Solved
Previously, games with different numbers of questions would have different total possible scores, making it difficult to compare performance across different quizzes.

### Solution
The total score for any game is now scaled to exactly **1000 points**, regardless of the number of questions.

### Formula
```
base_score_per_question = 1000 / total_questions
```

### Implementation
```typescript
// Get total questions for game scaling (default to 10 if not available)
let totalQuestions = 10;
if (accessCode) {
    const gameDataKey = `mathquest:game:${accessCode}`;
    const gameData = await redisClient.get(gameDataKey);
    if (gameData) {
        const parsed = JSON.parse(gameData);
        if (parsed.questionUids && Array.isArray(parsed.questionUids)) {
            totalQuestions = parsed.questionUids.length;
        }
    }
}

const baseScorePerQuestion = 1000 / totalQuestions;
```

### Examples
- **5 questions:** Each worth up to 200 points (5 × 200 = 1000)
- **10 questions:** Each worth up to 100 points (10 × 100 = 1000)
- **20 questions:** Each worth up to 50 points (20 × 50 = 1000)

## ⚖️ Balanced Multiple Choice Scoring

### Problem Solved
Traditional "all or nothing" multiple choice scoring is unfair for questions with multiple correct answers. Students get no credit for partial knowledge.

### Solution
A balanced scoring formula that rewards selecting correct answers while penalizing incorrect selections proportionally.

### Formula
```
raw_score = max(0, (C_B / B) - (C_M / M))
```

Where:
- **B** = Total number of correct answers in the question
- **M** = Total number of incorrect answers in the question  
- **C_B** = Number of correct answers selected by the student
- **C_M** = Number of incorrect answers selected by the student

### Implementation
```typescript
if (question.multipleChoiceQuestion) {
    const mcq = question.multipleChoiceQuestion;
    const B = mcq.correctAnswers.filter(Boolean).length; // Total correct answers
    const M = mcq.correctAnswers.filter(x => !x).length; // Total incorrect answers
    
    let C_B = 0; // Correct answers selected
    let C_M = 0; // Incorrect answers selected
    
    if (Array.isArray(answer)) {
        // Multiple selections
        for (const selectedIndex of answer) {
            if (mcq.correctAnswers[selectedIndex]) {
                C_B++;
            } else {
                C_M++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Balanced scoring formula
    let rawScore = 0;
    if (M > 0) {
        rawScore = Math.max(0, (C_B / B) - (C_M / M));
    } else {
        rawScore = C_B / B; // If no incorrect options, just use correct ratio
    }
    
    correctnessScore = rawScore;
}
```

### Examples

#### Question: "Select all prime numbers" (A=2✓, B=4✗, C=3✓, D=6✗)
- **B = 2** (correct: A, C), **M = 2** (incorrect: B, D)

**Student selects A, C (both correct):**
- C_B = 2, C_M = 0
- Score = max(0, (2/2) - (0/2)) = 1.0 = **100%**

**Student selects A only (partial correct):**
- C_B = 1, C_M = 0  
- Score = max(0, (1/2) - (0/2)) = 0.5 = **50%**

**Student selects A, B (one correct, one wrong):**
- C_B = 1, C_M = 1
- Score = max(0, (1/2) - (1/2)) = 0.0 = **0%**

**Student selects A, B, C (two correct, one wrong):**
- C_B = 2, C_M = 1
- Score = max(0, (2/2) - (1/2)) = 0.5 = **50%**

### Benefits
- **Rewards partial knowledge:** Students get credit for what they know
- **Penalizes guessing:** Random selection typically yields negative scores
- **Balanced approach:** Penalty scales with the proportion of incorrect answers
- **Fair to all question types:** Works for single-answer and multi-answer questions

## 📈 Logarithmic Time Penalty

### Problem Solved
Linear time penalties (e.g., "lose 10 points per second") are too harsh and create unfair pressure. Small delays shouldn't drastically reduce scores.

### Solution
A logarithmic time penalty that increases slowly with time, applying a maximum penalty of 30% for using the full time limit.

### Formula
```
time_penalty_factor = min(1, log(t + 1) / log(T + 1))
final_score = base_score × (1 - α × time_penalty_factor)
```

Where:
- **t** = Time taken by the user (in seconds)
- **T** = Maximum time allowed for the question (in seconds)
- **α** = Penalty coefficient (0.3 = 30% maximum penalty)

### Implementation
```typescript
// Get duration from Redis timer key
const timeLimit = /* fetched from Redis timer data */;
const timeLimitSeconds = timeLimit / 1000;
const serverTimeSpentSeconds = Math.max(0, serverTimeSpent / 1000);

// Logarithmic time penalty
const alpha = 0.3; // 30% maximum penalty
const timePenaltyFactor = Math.min(1, Math.log(serverTimeSpentSeconds + 1) / Math.log(timeLimitSeconds + 1));

// Final score calculation  
const scoreBeforePenalty = baseScorePerQuestion * correctnessScore;
const timePenalty = scoreBeforePenalty * alpha * timePenaltyFactor;
const finalScore = Math.max(0, scoreBeforePenalty - timePenalty);
```

### Example Penalty Progression (30-second question)

| Time Taken | Penalty Factor | Score Retention | Example Score (1000 base) |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1s          | ~0.12          | ~96%           | 964 points               |
| 5s          | ~0.33          | ~90%           | 901 points               |
| 15s         | ~0.59          | ~82%           | 823 points               |
| 30s (max)   | 1.0            | 70%            | 700 points               |

### Benefits
- **Gentle progression:** Small delays have minimal impact
- **Fair maximum penalty:** Even slow answers retain 70% of points
- **Encourages speed:** Still rewards quick thinking
- **No harsh cliffs:** Smooth penalty curve prevents dramatic score drops

## 🚀 Redis-Only Implementation

### Problem Solved
The previous implementation queried the database for question duration during scoring, creating unnecessary load and slower response times.

### Solution
All scoring now uses Redis-only data sources for maximum performance.

### Data Sources
- **Game metadata:** `mathquest:game:{accessCode}` → Question count for scaling
- **Timer data:** `mathquest:timer:{accessCode}:{questionUid}` → Question duration
- **Answer storage:** `mathquest:game:answers:{accessCode}:{questionUid}` → Previous answers

### Implementation
```typescript
// Get duration from timer Redis key instead of database
let timeLimit = 60000; // Default 60 seconds in ms
if (accessCode) {
    try {
        let timerKey = `mathquest:timer:${accessCode}:${question.uid}`;
        let timerData = await redisClient.get(timerKey);
        
        if (timerData) {
            const parsed = JSON.parse(timerData);
            if (parsed.durationMs) {
                timeLimit = parsed.durationMs;
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        logger.warn({ error, accessCode, questionUid: question.uid }, 
                    'Failed to get duration from timer Redis key, using default');
    }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Improved performance:** No database queries during scoring
- **Consistent with timer system:** Uses same duration data as the live timer
- **Graceful fallback:** Defaults to reasonable values when Redis data unavailable
- **Real-time accuracy:** Duration matches exactly what users see

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Created
**File:** `backend/tests/unit/new-scoring-strategy.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ **Multiple choice perfect answer:** Full credit with time penalty
- ✅ **Multiple choice partial answer:** Proportional credit (50% correct = ~50% score)
- ✅ **Multiple choice negative score:** Zero points for net negative answers
- ✅ **Numeric question scoring:** Binary correct/incorrect with tolerance
- ✅ **Logarithmic time penalty:** Validates penalty progression (fast > medium > slow)
- ✅ **Missing Redis data:** Graceful fallback to defaults

#### Example Test Results
```
Multiple choice (2 correct out of 3 options, select both correct):
- Base score: 500 points (1000/2 questions)
- Time penalty: ~30 points (1s on 30s limit)
- Final score: ~470 points

Numeric question (correct answer):
- Base score: 1000 points (single question)
- Time penalty: ~68 points (1s on 20s limit)  
- Final score: ~932 points

Time penalty progression (30s limit):
- 0.5s answer: ~965 points (96.5%)
- 15s answer: ~758 points (75.8%)
- 30s answer: 700 points (70.0%)
```
