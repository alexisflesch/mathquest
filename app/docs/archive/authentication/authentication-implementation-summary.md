# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the unified 4-state authentication system for MathQuest, resolving the original issues with profile data loss during guest account upgrades.

---

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### Primary Issue: Profile Data Loss
**Problem**: Guest users upgrading to student accounts lost their chosen username and avatar, reverting to defaults ("Élève" and random avatar).

**Root Cause**: Backend upgrade-guest endpoint used hardcoded defaults instead of preserving guest profile data.

**Solution**: Complete overhaul of authentication system with unified endpoints and proper profile preservation.

### Secondary Issue: Code Duplication
**Problem**: Multiple duplicate registration endpoints violating DRY principles.

**Solution**: Consolidated all authentication flows into unified endpoints.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Unified Authentication Endpoints
- **`POST /api/v1/auth/register`**: Universal registration for guests, students, and teachers
- **`POST /api/v1/auth/upgrade`**: Universal upgrade for all upgrade scenarios
- **`PUT /api/v1/auth/profile`**: Profile updates for authenticated users

#### 2. UserService Enhancement
- Added `upgradeUser()` method for updating existing users
- Proper handling of email, password, and role changes
- Avatar validation using `AllowedAvatar` type

#### 3. Profile Preservation Logic
- Guest profiles stored in database with cookieId
- Upgrade endpoints preserve username and avatar
- Proper lookup mechanism using `getUserByCookieId()`

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. AuthProvider Updates
- Implemented 4-state system: `anonymous` → `guest` → `student` → `teacher`
- Updated registration methods to use unified endpoints
- Database persistence for guest profiles

#### 2. Component Integration
- Updated `AuthProvider.tsx` to use new endpoints
- Profile management in `/profile` page
- Unified login page supporting all authentication types

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

### Guest Registration
```
1. User enters username + avatar on /login?mode=guest
2. Frontend calls POST /auth/register with cookieId
3. Profile stored in database + localStorage
4. User can join games immediately
```

### Guest → Student Upgrade
```
1. Guest navigates to /profile
2. Enters email + password in upgrade form
3. Frontend calls POST /auth/upgrade with cookieId
4. Backend finds guest by cookieId, preserves profile
5. User becomes authenticated student with same username/avatar
```

### Guest → Teacher Upgrade
```
1. Guest navigates to /profile → teacher tab
2. Enters email + password + admin password
3. Frontend calls POST /auth/upgrade with role: "TEACHER"
4. Backend validates admin password, preserves profile
5. User becomes teacher with same username/avatar
```
