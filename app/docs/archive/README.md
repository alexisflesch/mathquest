## Legacy Archive Files

The `ARCHIVE_*` files are historical documentation from earlier project phases. These are kept for reference but represent systems that have been completely rewritten or superseded.

## Status

All documentation in this archive represents **completed work**. These files are preserved for historical reference and to understand the project's evolution, but the systems they describe are now fully implemented and working.

For current system documentation, see the main `/docs/` directory.
