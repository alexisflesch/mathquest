# Frontend Update Progress – Reconnecting to New Backend

_Last updated: 2025-06-01_

## Purpose
Tracks the progress of updating the frontend to match the rewritten backend (API, socket events, types, room naming, etc.).

- [Frontend Architecture](./frontend-architecture.md)
- [Socket Integration](./socket.md)
- [Practice Mode Integration](./practice-mode-integration-phase.md)

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The backend has been completely rewritten with new:
- Socket event names and payload structures
- REST API endpoints and authentication flows
- Strict TypeScript typing conventions
- Room naming conventions and authentication patterns

The frontend requires a complete update to reconnect with this new backend system.

---

## Unified Gameplay Handler: `live/[code]`

The `live/[code]` page serves as a unified entry point for all play modes (`tournament`, `practice`, `quiz`). Its behavior dynamically adapts based on the active mode, with key responsibilities delegated to either the backend or the client:

- **`tournament`**: The backend fully manages the timer. When time runs out, it sends the list of correct answers, followed (if available) by an `explication` (feedback) event including a display duration. After this delay, the backend is responsible for either sending the next question or emitting a signal indicating the end of the tournament. The client does not autonomously advance the game state.

- **`practice`**: No timer is handled by the backend. After submitting an answer, the client emits a socket event to request the correct answers. The backend responds with the list of correct answers, waits for 1.5 seconds, then sends an optional feedback. The client handles closing the feedback and requesting the next question. There is no timer on the feedback phase, and the client is responsible for managing the flow of questions.

- **`quiz`**: The timer is backend-managed but can be paused, resumed, or reset at any time by the teacher. The backend does **not** automatically send the correct answers or feedback — the teacher controls when and whether these are revealed. Likewise, the progression to the next question is entirely teacher-driven.

This architecture allows for maximum code reuse while supporting distinct pedagogical workflows across all modes.

> **Note:**
> During integration, we discovered an issue with multiple `.env` files in the project (root and backend folders). The backend uses `/backend/.env` for its JWT secret, which must match the secret used for signing and verifying tokens. If the frontend or test scripts use a different secret (e.g., from the root `.env`), authentication will fail with `invalid signature` errors. Always ensure the backend `.env` is correct and loaded before running backend or debug scripts.

  - ✅ Main `AppNav` component shows user profile in collapsible sidebar
  - ✅ Profile buttons and links integrated in all navigation states
- ✅ **State-Specific Navigation** - Dynamic menu items based on authentication state
- ✅ **Profile Integration** - Direct links to `/profile` page from all navbar states

### 12. Testing & Documentation ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETE**
- ✅ Socket hook testing complete (77/77 tests passing)
- ✅ Profile management system tested and functional
- ✅ Authentication flows tested across all states
- 🚧 **Integration tests for updated feedback flows** - Minor testing gaps remain
- 🚧 **End-to-end testing for all updated game modes** - Final validation needed
- 🚧 **Updated documentation** - README, components.md updates in progress

## 🚨 **Key Discoveries**

### Backend Phase 7 & 8 Completion Analysis ⚠️
Comprehensive analysis of backend documentation reveals significant changes requiring frontend updates:

### 1. Practice Mode Architecture Changes 🔄
- **New Socket Flow**: Practice mode now uses socket events (`join_game`, `game_answer`, `request_next_question`, `game_ended`)
- **Manual Progression**: Players must explicitly request next question instead of automatic progression
- **Feedback System**: Immediate answer feedback with `answer_received` event containing correctness and explanations
- **isDiffered Flag**: Practice mode requires `isDiffered: true` parameter in join events
- **Self-Paced Nature**: No enforced timers, but optional feedback phase timers supported

### 2. Enhanced Feedback System Architecture 🆕
Backend implements comprehensive feedback system across all modes:
- **Immediate Feedback**: `answer_received` events provide instant feedback with correct answers
- **Feedback Phases**: Quiz mode supports feedback phases with configurable `feedbackWaitTime`
- **Mode-Specific Behavior**: Different feedback timing for quiz (configurable) vs tournament (1.5s) vs practice (immediate)
- **Phase Transitions**: question → feedback → show_answers phase management
- **Optional Timers**: Feedback phases can have optional countdown timers

### 3. Timer Management Responsibility Division ⚙️
Backend documentation reveals specific timer responsibility architecture:
- **Backend Authority**: Backend is single source of truth for timer values and status
- **Frontend Display**: Frontend only handles local countdown display from backend-provided values
- **No Optimistic Updates**: Frontend must never predict or update timer state independently
- **Event-Driven**: Timer updates only occur via backend events (no ticking timer from server)
- **Teacher Controls**: Quiz mode supports teacher timer controls (start/pause/resume/stop/set_duration)

### 4. Quiz Mode Dashboard Updates 🔧
Phase 8 completion shows major dashboard architecture changes:
- **New Event Names**: `join_dashboard` replaces `join_teacher_control`, `quiz_timer_action` for timer control
- **Room Naming**: `dashboard_${gameId}` and `projection_${gameId}` replace older patterns
- **Comprehensive State**: `game_control_state` provides complete dashboard data including correct answers
- **Granular Updates**: Specific events for question changes, timer updates, answer lock changes
- **Enhanced Controls**: Answer locking, game ending, question navigation with proper state sync

### 5. Tournament Mode Validation Required ✅
- **Feedback Integration**: Need to validate support for `correct_answers` and optional `feedback` events
- **Timer Compatibility**: Ensure tournament timer logic follows new responsibility division
- **Phase Management**: Validate question/feedback/show_answers phase transitions
- **Backend Control**: Confirm tournament flow matches backend's automated progression

### Live Tournament Page Already Migrated ✅
The Live Tournament Page was discovered to already be fully compatible with the new backend:
- Uses correct socket events (`join_tournament`, `game_question`, `submit_answer`)
- Proper payload structures with `accessCode`, `userId`, `avatarEmoji`
- Comprehensive error handling and reconnection logic
- All integration tests passing (21 frontend + 18 backend tests)

### Tournament Answer Result Handler Implementation ✅
Recent completion of the tournament feedback system:

**Problem**: Tournament mode was missing proper handling of `tournament_answer_result` events from the backend, which provide feedback on answer submissions including rejection reasons and success confirmations.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive tournament answer result handler in `useStudentGameSocket`:

**Key Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Added TypeScript interface for tournament answer results
interface TournamentAnswerResult {
  questionUid: string;
  rejected?: boolean;
  reason?: string;
  message?: string;
  registered?: boolean;
  updated?: boolean;
}

// Added socket event constant
TOURNAMENT_ANSWER_RESULT: 'tournament_answer_result'

// Implemented event handler that converts tournament feedback to AnswerReceived format
socket.on(SOCKET_EVENTS.TOURNAMENT.TOURNAMENT_ANSWER_RESULT, (data: TournamentAnswerResult) => {
  // Convert to compatible format and update game state
  // Handle both success and rejection scenarios
  // Update answered status and lastAnswerFeedback
});
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/hooks/useStudentGameSocket.ts` - Added tournament answer result handler
- `/shared/types/socket/events.ts` - Added `TOURNAMENT_ANSWER_RESULT` constant  
- `/frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useStudentGameSocket.initialization.test.ts` - Updated test expectations

**Test Results**: All 128 useStudentGameSocket tests passing, including 56 individual test cases across 6 test suites.

### TypeScript Socket Pattern Established ✅
Resolved TypeScript strongly-typed socket interface conflicts:
```typescript
// PATTERN: Import for documentation, use literals for emit
import { GAME_EVENTS } from '@shared/types/socket/events';
socket.emit('game_error', payload); // Use literal string
socket.on(GAME_EVENTS.GAME_ERROR, handler); // Use constant for listeners
```
