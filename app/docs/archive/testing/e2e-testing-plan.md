# MathQuest End-to-End Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the E2E testing strategy for MathQuest, focusing on complete user journey validation after achieving comprehensive unit test coverage (100% backend passing, extensive frontend hook testing).

## Testing Framework Recommendation
- **Playwright** or **Cypress** for browser automation
- **Existing development environment** (no Docker required for initial implementation)
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD integration (Docker can be added later if needed)

## Development Environment Setup
- Use existing backend (localhost:3007) and frontend (localhost:3000)
- Leverage current test database and Redis instances
- Tests run against live development servers
- Clean database state between test runs

## Priority E2E Test Scenarios

### 1. Complete Quiz Flow (High Priority)
**User Journey**: Teacher creates quiz ‚Üí Students join ‚Üí Real-time gameplay ‚Üí Results display

**Test Steps**:
1. Teacher logs in and creates a quiz with 3 questions
2. Teacher starts the quiz and shares access code
3. 2-3 students join using the access code
4. Teacher progresses through questions with timer
5. Students submit answers in real-time
6. Verify live participant list updates
7. Verify final results and leaderboard accuracy

**Validation Points**:
- Socket.IO real-time updates work correctly
- Timer synchronization across all clients
- Answer submission and scoring accuracy
- UI state consistency across teacher/student views

### 2. Tournament Mode Competition (High Priority)
**User Journey**: Multiple students compete in real-time tournament

**Test Steps**:
1. Create tournament with specific themes/difficulty
2. 4+ students join tournament lobby
3. Tournament starts with countdown
4. Students answer questions simultaneously
5. Live leaderboard updates after each question
6. Tournament concludes with final rankings

**Validation Points**:
- Real-time leaderboard accuracy
- Simultaneous answer handling
- Tournament progression logic
- Performance under concurrent load

### 3. Tournament Deferred Mode (High Priority)
**User Journey**: Tournament runs in deferred mode where students can join and play at different times

**Test Steps**:
1. Teacher creates tournament in deferred mode
2. Sets tournament duration/deadline
3. First batch of students join and complete tournament
4. Second batch of students join later (while tournament still active)
5. Students complete tournament at their own pace
6. Final leaderboard aggregates all participants across time periods

**Validation Points**:
- Deferred mode tournament creation and configuration
- Students can join at different times
- Individual completion tracking works correctly
- Leaderboard accurately reflects all participants
- Tournament deadline enforcement
- Session state persistence across different join times

### 4. Late-Joiners for Live Sessions (High Priority)
**User Journey**: Students attempt to join live quiz/tournament after it has already started

**Test Steps**:
1. Teacher starts live quiz/tournament with initial students
2. Progress through 1-2 questions with initial participants
3. New students attempt to join using access code
4. Verify late-joiners are handled appropriately (join mid-session or blocked)
5. Test different scenarios: early questions vs. late in session
6. Verify UI messaging for late-join attempts

**Validation Points**:
- Late-join policies work as expected
- Clear messaging for students trying to join late
- No disruption to ongoing session for existing participants
- Proper session state handling for mid-game joins
- Access code remains valid/invalid as configured

### 5. Teacher Timer Controls (High Priority)
**User Journey**: Teacher manages quiz timing during live session with various timer operations

**Test Steps**:
1. Teacher starts quiz with timer-enabled questions
2. During active question, teacher pauses timer
3. Verify all student interfaces show paused state
4. Teacher resumes timer and confirms countdown continues
5. Teacher extends timer duration mid-question
6. Teacher manually advances to next question before timer expires
7. Test timer behavior across different question types

**Validation Points**:
- Timer pause/resume works across all connected clients
- Timer synchronization maintained after pause/resume
- Timer extension reflects correctly on all clients
- Manual question advancement works properly
- No timing conflicts or race conditions
- Student submission states handled correctly during timer operations

### 6. Practice Mode Self-Paced Learning (Medium Priority)
**User Journey**: Student practices independently with feedback

**Test Steps**:
1. Student selects practice mode with specific topics
2. Student answers questions at their own pace
3. Immediate feedback displays after each answer
4. Student uses "J'ai compris" to continue
5. Session completes with summary

**Validation Points**:
- Self-paced progression works correctly
- Feedback overlay displays properly
- Progress tracking accuracy
- Session state persistence

### 7. Cross-Browser Compatibility (Medium Priority)
**Browsers to Test**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

**Focus Areas**:
- Socket.IO connection stability
- WebSocket fallback behavior
- Real-time event handling
- UI consistency across browsers

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness (Medium Priority)
**Devices to Test**: iPhone, Android phones, tablets

**Focus Areas**:
- Touch interactions work correctly
- Responsive layout functions properly
- Virtual keyboard doesn't break UI
- Socket connections stable on mobile networks

### 9. Network Resilience (Low Priority)
**Test Scenarios**:
- Intermittent network connectivity
- High latency conditions
- Connection drops and reconnections
- Socket.IO reconnection handling

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Setup (30-60 minutes)
1. Install Playwright ‚è±Ô∏è **15 minutes**
2. Configure test environment against existing dev setup ‚è±Ô∏è **15-30 minutes**
3. Create first basic test ‚è±Ô∏è **15 minutes**
4. Set up test data cleanup utilities ‚è±Ô∏è **15 minutes**

### Phase 2: Core Flows (4-6 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
1. ‚úÖ **Implement Quiz Flow E2E test** ‚è±Ô∏è **1-1.5 hours** - `tests/e2e/quiz-flow.spec.ts`
2. ‚úÖ **Implement Tournament Mode E2E test (live)** ‚è±Ô∏è **1-1.5 hours** - `tests/e2e/tournament-mode.spec.ts`

## Success Criteria
- All critical user journeys pass E2E tests
- Tests run reliably against development environment
- Test execution time under 5 minutes for core flows
- Clear failure reporting and debugging info
- Easy setup for new developers (no complex environment requirements)

## Maintenance Strategy
- Run E2E tests manually before major releases
- Core test suite can be automated in CI/CD when ready
- Quarterly review and update of test scenarios
- Docker environment can be added later for production-like testing
