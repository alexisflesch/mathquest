  - Timer extension during active questions
  - Manual question advancement before timer expiry
  - Timer behavior across different question types
  - Student submission state handling during timer operations
  - Race condition prevention

#### âœ… Practice Mode Self-Paced (`tests/e2e/practice-mode.spec.ts`)
- **Coverage**: Student practices independently with immediate feedback
- **Key Features**:
  - Topic and difficulty selection
  - Self-paced progression (no timer pressure)
  - Immediate feedback after each answer
  - Educational explanations for wrong answers
  - "J'ai compris" continuation mechanism
  - Session completion summary
  - Progress tracking and session persistence

### 2. E2E Testing Infrastructure

#### âœ… Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
- Single worker configuration for real-time testing
- Development server auto-start (backend:3007, frontend:3000)
- Test environment configuration
- Browser setup (Chrome primary, Firefox/Safari commented for later)
- Screenshot/video capture on failure
- Global setup/teardown integration

#### âœ… Test Helpers (`tests/e2e/helpers/test-helpers.ts`)
- `TestDataHelper`: Unique test data generation, teacher/student account creation
- `LoginHelper`: Authentication flows for teachers and students
- `SocketHelper`: Socket.IO connection management and event waiting

#### âœ… Global Setup/Teardown
- `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`: Test environment preparation
- `tests/e2e/global-teardown.ts`: Cleanup after test runs

#### âœ… Package Scripts
- `npm run test:e2e`: Run E2E test suite
- `npm run test:e2e:ui`: Run with Playwright UI
- `npm run test:e2e:debug`: Run in debug mode

## Test Architecture Highlights

### Multi-User Real-Time Testing
All tests are designed to handle multiple concurrent browser contexts:
- Separate teacher and student browser contexts
- Real-time Socket.IO interaction validation
- Cross-client state synchronization testing
- Realistic user interaction simulation

### Comprehensive Coverage Areas
1. **Authentication & Authorization**: Teacher/student login flows
2. **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO event handling and synchronization
3. **Session Management**: Quiz creation, joining, progression, completion
4. **Timer Operations**: All timer control scenarios and edge cases
5. **User Experience**: UI state consistency, error handling, feedback systems
6. **Data Persistence**: Session state, progress tracking, results accuracy

### Test Data Management
- Unique test data generation using timestamps
- Isolated test accounts for each scenario
- Cleanup mechanisms to prevent test pollution

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Phase 1 & 2)
- E2E framework setup with Playwright
- All 6 core test scenarios implemented
- Test infrastructure and helpers complete
- Configuration and scripts ready

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Execution
The complete E2E test suite is now ready to run against the development environment:

1. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:backend  # localhost:3007
   npm run dev:frontend # localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Run E2E tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e        # Full test suite
   npm run test:e2e:ui     # With Playwright UI
   npm run test:e2e:debug  # Debug mode
   ```

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps (Phase 3 & 4 - Optional)

#### Phase 3: Extended Coverage (2-3 hours)
- Cross-browser testing (Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness (iPhone, Android, tablets)
- Network resilience (connection drops, high latency)

#### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (1-2 hours)
- GitHub Actions workflow setup
- Docker environment for CI (if needed)
- Automated test execution on pull requests
