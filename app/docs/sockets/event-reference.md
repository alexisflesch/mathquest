# Socket Event Reference

This document lists all Socket.IO events used in MathQuest, their payloads, and which handler emits/receives them.

## Self-Paced (Practice/Differed) Mode

In self-paced (practice/differed) mode:
- The player is responsible for advancing the quiz; there is **no real timer** managed by the backend.
- Practice mode follows this event flow:
  1. Player joins game with `join_game` event including `isDiffered: true`.
  2. Player receives `game_question` with first question.
  3. Player answers with `game_answer` event.
  4. Backend immediately responds with `answer_received` containing correctness feedback.
  5. **Note**: Player must explicitly request the next question with `request_next_question` event.
  6. Backend sends next question with `game_question` event.
  7. For the last question, after reviewing feedback, player must request the next question.
  8. Since there are no more questions, backend responds with `game_ended` with final score.
- All events are sent only to the individual player (never to a shared room).
- The event flow and payloads differ from tournament mode in these ways:
  - No timer events are sent.
  - No leaderboard is calculated or sent.
  - Only the player receives their results and feedback.
  - Players must explicitly request to proceed after each question, including the last one.

  "leaderboard": [ /* array of leaderboard entries */ ]

- `gameState`: The current game state object (see backend `GameState` type for details).
- `participants`: Array of participant objects.
- `answers`: Object mapping question IDs to arrays of answers.
- `leaderboard`: Array of leaderboard entries.

> **Note:** As of May 2025, the `projector_state` payload always includes `accessCode` as a top-level property.
