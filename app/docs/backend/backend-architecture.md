# MathQuest Backend - Technical Architecture & Shared Logic Guide

> **Note:** This is the canonical technical reference for the MathQuest backend. It covers architecture, real-time/event-driven logic, state management, shared live logic, type-safety improvements, and best practices. All contributors should refer here for backend design and extension.

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive technical reference for MathQuest's backend, focusing on the real-time game logic, state management, and event-driven architecture. It is intended for AI agents and developers who need to understand, debug, or extend the backend logic.

## 1. Architecture & Main Concepts

### 1.1. Real-Time Engine
- **Socket.IO** is used for all real-time communication between clients (students, teachers, projector) and the server.
- The backend is split into three main handler domains:
  - **Quiz Handlers**: Teacher dashboard, quiz control, projector view.
  - **Tournament Handlers**: Student gameplay, scoring, answer submission.
  - **Lobby Handlers**: Waiting room before tournaments start.

### 1.2. In-Memory State
- **quizState**: Tracks all active quizzes (teacher dashboards), keyed by quizId.
- **tournamentState**: Tracks all active tournaments (live and differed), keyed by code (or code+joueurId for differed).
- **lobbyParticipants**: Tracks participants in each lobby room.

### 1.3. Event-Driven Design
- Each handler registers event listeners for specific socket events (e.g., `quiz_set_question`, `tournament_answer`).
- Event handlers update in-memory state, interact with the database (via Prisma), and emit events to relevant rooms.

---

## 2. File & Folder Structure

- `/sockets/quizHandler.js` - Registers all quiz-related events and manages quizState.
- `/sockets/quizEvents.js` - Imports and registers all quiz event handlers.
- `/sockets/quizEventHandlers/` - Individual files for each quiz event (setQuestion, timerAction, lock, unlock, etc).
- `/sockets/quizState.js` - Central in-memory state for quizzes.
- `/sockets/quizUtils.js` - Utilities for quiz state patching, connected count, etc.

- `/sockets/tournamentHandler.js` - Registers all tournament-related events and manages tournamentState.
- `/sockets/tournamentEvents.js` - Imports and registers all tournament event handlers.
- `/sockets/tournamentEventHandlers/` - Individual files for each tournament event (join, answer, pause, resume, etc).
- `/sockets/tournamentUtils/` - Helpers for scoring, state, and stats.
- `/sockets/tournamentUtils/tournamentState.js` - Central in-memory state for tournaments.

- `/sockets/lobbyHandler.js` - Handles lobby join/leave, participant tracking, and lobby events.

- `/sockets/sharedLiveLogic/` - Directory for logic shared between quiz and tournament modes.
  - `emitQuestionResults.ts` - Shared function to emit standardized `question_results` events.
  - `sendQuestion.ts` - Shared function to emit standardized `game_question` events to clients.
  - `emitParticipantScoreUpdate.ts` - Shared function to emit `participant_score_update` events with detailed scoring information to individual participants.

## 3. In-Memory State Models

### 3.1. quizState (per quizId)
- `currentQuestionIdx`: Index of the active question.
- `questions`: Array of question objects.
- `chrono`: `{ timeLeft, running }` - Timer state.
- `locked`: Boolean, whether answers are locked.
- `ended`: Boolean, whether the quiz is finished.
- `profSocketId`: Socket ID of the teacher.
- `profuserId`: Teacher's DB ID.
- `timerStatus`, `timerQuestionId`, `timerTimeLeft`, `timerTimestamp`: Timer tracking for real-time sync.
- `tournament_code`: Linked tournament code (if any).
- `connectedSockets`: Set of connected socket IDs.

### 3.2. tournamentState (per code or code+joueurId)
- `participants`: Map of joueurId to participant info (username, avatar, score, etc).
- `questions`: Array of question objects.
- `currentIndex`: Index of the current question.
- `answers`: Map of joueurId to their answers per question.
- `timer`: Node.js timer for question expiration.
- `questionStart`: Timestamp when the current question started.
- `paused`, `pausedRemainingTime`, `stopped`: Timer control flags.
- `linkedQuizId`: If quiz-linked, the quizId.
- `currentQuestionDuration`: Duration for the current question.
- `socketToJoueur`: Map of socketId to joueurId.
- `isDiffered`: Boolean, for differed tournaments.
- `statut`: Tournament status (en préparation, en cours, terminé).

## 4. Event Handler Breakdown

### 4.1. Quiz Event Handlers (`/sockets/quizEventHandlers/`)
- **joinQuizHandler.js**: Handles teacher/projector/student joining a quiz room. Initializes quizState if needed.
- **setQuestionHandler.js**: Sets the active question, updates quizState, triggers tournament question if linked, emits state to dashboard/projector.
- **timerActionHandler.js**: Handles play/pause/stop actions from the teacher. Updates quizState, triggers tournament timer if linked.
- **setTimerHandler.js**: Edits the timer for the current question. Updates quizState and tournamentState if linked.
- **lockHandler.js / unlockHandler.js**: Locks/unlocks answer submission for the current question.
- **endHandler.js**: Ends the quiz, updates state, and (if linked) forces tournament end.
- **pauseHandler.js / resumeHandler.js**: Pauses/resumes the quiz and linked tournament.
- **closeQuestionHandler.js**: Closes a question, computes correct answers using `scoreUtils.ts`, updates participant total scores, calculates ranks, emits `participant_score_update` to individual participants, and `question_results` (including correct answers and leaderboard) to projector/teacher.
- **disconnectingHandler.js**: Cleans up quizState and emits updated connected count.

### 4.2. Tournament Event Handlers (`/sockets/tournamentEventHandlers/`)

- `quiz_set_timer` → Edits timer, updates state, triggers tournament timer if linked.
- `quiz_lock` / `quiz_unlock` → Locks/unlocks answers.
- `quiz_end` → Ends quiz, triggers tournament end if linked.
- `quiz_pause` / `quiz_resume` → Pauses/resumes quiz and linked tournament.
- `quiz_close_question` → Closes question, emits results.

### 5.2. Tournament (Student Gameplay)
- `start_tournament` → Initializes tournamentState, emits `tournament_started` to lobby.
- `join_tournament` → Finds/creates Joueur, joins `game_${code}` room, sends current question.

## 6. Tournament & Quiz Lifecycle

### 6.1. Classic Tournament
1. Teacher starts tournament (`start_tournament`).
2. Students join lobby, then tournament room.
3. Questions are sent in order, timer managed by backend.
4. Answers are scored, leaderboard updated.
5. At end, leaderboard is emitted, scores saved to DB.

### 6.2. Quiz-Linked Tournament
1. Teacher controls quiz via dashboard (`quiz_set_question`, `quiz_timer_action`).
2. Tournament state is updated in sync with quizState.
3. Students receive questions/timers as teacher advances.
4. At end, leaderboard is emitted, scores saved.

### 6.3. Differed Tournament
- Each student gets their own state (keyed by code+joueurId).
- Questions are served sequentially, timer per user.
- Scores are saved at the end, leaderboard updated.

---

## 7. Scoring, Stats, and Leaderboard
- **Scoring**: `calculateScore` in `scoreUtils.ts` computes the score for a given question. The logic includes:
  - A time penalty: linear, ranging from 0 for an immediate answer to 500 points for a last-second answer.
  - Question Correct Unique (QCU): 1000 points if the unique correct answer is chosen, 0 otherwise.
  - Question Correct Multiple (QCM): 1000 points divided by the number of correct answers for each correctly chosen option. Incorrectly chosen options result in a negative score for that option, but the total score for a QCM question cannot go below 0. If a QCM question has only one correct answer, it is treated as a QCU.
  - Normalization: The final score for a question is divided by the total number of questions in the event (quiz or tournament) to get the points added to the participant's total score.
- **Stats**: `computeStats.js` aggregates answer stats for histograms.
- **Leaderboard**: Built from participants' scores, emitted at end or on demand (typically as part of the `question_results` event).

## 8. UI-to-Backend Mapping
- UI emits socket events (see above) with payloads (quizId, code, questionUid, etc).
- Backend handlers update state, emit events to rooms (dashboard, projector, students).
- All state changes are reflected in real-time to all relevant clients.

---

## 9. Best Practices & Extension Points
- **Always use the logger** for debug/info/warn/error.
- **Never mutate state directly** outside handlers/utilities.
- **Add new events** by creating a handler in the appropriate folder and registering it.
- **Keep state shape consistent**; always check for undefined/null before accessing nested fields.
- **For new features**, follow the modular event-driven pattern.

## 10. Shared Live Logic Refactoring (Quiz & Tournament)

### Goal
Reduce code duplication and improve maintainability by consolidating shared logic between quiz and tournament modes. This makes the codebase DRYer and easier to extend.

### Approach
- Shared logic is housed in `app/backend/sockets/sharedLiveLogic/`.
- Common functionalities (emitting results, sending questions, score updates) are extracted into generic modules.
- Both quiz and tournament handlers use these shared modules.

### Key Refactorings & Type-Safety Improvements

#### 1. Emitting Question Results & Scores
- `emitQuestionResults(io, roomName, params)` is used to broadcast correct answers and leaderboard to a room.
- `emitParticipantScoreUpdate(socket, data)` sends per-participant score updates.
- Tournament and quiz flows both use these shared functions for result emission.

#### 2. Sending Questions
- `sendQuestion.ts` standardizes the `game_question` event payload for both modes.

#### 3. Handling Answers
- Tournament answer handlers ensure answers are only registered if the question is active.
- Score/rank is only sent when the question concludes, not immediately on answer.

#### 4. Scoring Logic
- Common scoring patterns are abstracted into shared utilities, with mode-specific extensions as needed.

#### 5. Session End/Stop Signal
- Shared mechanism for handling "stop" signals and redirection to leaderboards.

#### 6. Type-Safety Improvements
- Enhanced type constraints for room names (template literal types).
- Flexible parameter objects for shared functions.
- Unified event payload types and Zod validation.
- Consistent import/export patterns for state objects.

#### 7. Process
- Identify shared logic, move to sharedLiveLogic, update handlers, test incrementally.

## 12. Timer Management & Synchronization

### 12.1. Single Source of Truth
- The backend is the single source of truth for all timer values.
- Timer values are always stored with 1 decimal place precision.
- Frontend never determines timer values; it only displays and sends control actions.

### 12.2. Backend Timer Sources (in order of precedence)
- When starting a question: Value comes from the question object's `temps` field
- When pausing: Backend calculates and stores the precise remaining time
- When resuming: Backend uses its stored `pausedRemainingTime` value
- When editing: Frontend sends an explicit update via `quiz_set_timer`

### 12.3. Key Timer State Fields
- In quizState:
  - `chrono.timeLeft`: Timer value in seconds (with 1 decimal precision)
  - `timerTimeLeft`: Duplicate of chrono.timeLeft for compatibility
  - `timerInitialValue`: Original timer value for the current question
  - `timerTimestamp`: When the timer was last started
  - `timerStatus`: Current status ('play', 'pause', 'stop')

- In tournamentState:
  - `currentQuestionDuration`: Total time for the question
  - `pausedRemainingTime`: Stored time when paused
  - `paused`, `stopped`: Boolean flags for timer state
  - `questionStart`: Timestamp when question timer started

### 12.4. Timer Synchronization Logic
- `synchronizeTimerValues()` in `quizUtils.js` ensures consistent timer values between quiz and tournament states
- `triggerTournamentPause()`, `triggerTournamentTimerSet()` in `tournamentTriggers.js` manage timer state transitions
- `updateChrono()` in `quizUtils.js` maintains synchronized timer properties

### 12.5. Frontend Timer Handling
- Frontend uses `quiz_timer_update` events to synchronize its local timer
- Frontend maintains a local timer only for smooth UI countdown between updates
- For pause/resume actions, frontend never sends timeLeft values to backend
- Only explicit timer edits (`emitSetTimer`) send time values to the backend
- Frontend relies on socket events rather than polling for timer updates (fix: removed polling mechanism)

## 13. Known Issues & Solutions

### 13.1. Quiz State Synchronization Bug

#### Issue: 
A critical bug was identified where `currentQuestionUid` in the `quizState` was not being properly synchronized across different components of the application. This manifested as the dashboard/projection views showing "question A" as active, while the backend was processing "question B" during timer actions.

#### Root Cause:
1. **Inconsistent Import Pattern**: In `quizEvents.js` and certain other files, `quizState` was imported directly as:
   ```javascript
   const quizState = require('./quizState');
   ```
   But the correct export from `quizState.js` had it as a property:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = { quizState: _quizState, createDefaultQuestionTimer, getQuestionTimer };
   ```

   This created separate, disconnected copies of the state object, where:
   - Some files accessed the correct shared state via proper destructuring: `const { quizState } = require('./quizState');`
   - Other files created local copies that didn't reflect updates made elsewhere

2. **Timer vs. currentQuestionUid Desynchronization**: When a timer action occurred, `timerQuestionId` would be updated correctly, but the `currentQuestionUid` property, accessed through the incorrect import, wasn't being synchronized.

#### Solution:
1. **Consistent Import Pattern**: Updated all imports in `quizEvents.js` and other affected files to properly destructure the quizState object:
   ```javascript
   const { quizState } = require('./quizState');
   ```

2. **Explicit Synchronization**: Added checks to synchronize `currentQuestionUid` with `timerQuestionId` when:
   - A state object is first accessed/initialized (`ensureQuizStateInitialized`)
   - Timer actions occur (`timerActionHandler.js`)
   - Quiz state is requested (`get_quiz_state` handler)
   - State is patched for broadcast (`patchQuizStateForBroadcast`)

3. **Property Redundancy**: Ensured both `id` and `quizId` properties are set on state objects to prevent "UNKNOWN_QUIZ_ID" issues in logs and to ensure consistent identification.

#### Prevention:
- Added extensive logging around state synchronization points
- Implemented destructuring imports consistently across all files
- Added explicit property validation in state access functions
