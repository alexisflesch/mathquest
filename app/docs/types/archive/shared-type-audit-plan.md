# [ARCHIVED] MathQuest Shared Type Audit & Migration Plan

## 1. Current State
- **Shared types**: `/shared/types/socketEvents.ts` contains core socket payloads (`QuestionData`, `ParticipantData`, etc.).
- **Legacy/duplicate types**: Many local/legacy types exist in the frontend, e.g.:
  - `Question`, `Response`, `QuizState`, `TournamentQuestion`, `TournamentGameState`, `LeaderboardEntry`, `Participant`, `Answer`, `Feedback`, etc.
- **Field name inconsistencies**: e.g., `question` vs `text`, `reponses` vs `answerOptions`, `type` vs `questionType`.
- **Backend is canonical**: The backend is considered the source of truth for all shared types and field names. The frontend must adapt to the backend's canonical/shared types. Backend code should not be changed unless absolutely necessary.

## 2. What Should Be Shared?
- **Question types**: Canonicalize on `QuestionData` (with `uid`, `text`, `answerOptions`, `correctAnswers`, `questionType`, etc.).
- **Participant types**: Use `ParticipantData` everywhere.
- **Leaderboard types**: Use `LeaderboardEntryData`.
- **Game/tournament state**: Define a shared `GameState`/`TournamentState` interface for cross-role state.
- **Answer/feedback types**: Unify answer payloads and feedback/result types.
- **Timer types**: Use shared timer state/payloads.
- **Socket event payloads**: All event payloads should be defined in `/shared/types/socketEvents.ts`.

## 3. Audit & Migration Plan

### Step 1: Audit for Duplicates
- Search for all `interface` and `type` definitions in the frontend, especially for:
  - `Question`, `QuizState`, `TournamentState`, `Participant`, `LeaderboardEntry`, `Answer`, `Feedback`, `Timer`, `GameState`, etc.
- Identify all places where these are defined locally or with different field names.

### Step 2: Canonicalize in `/shared/types/`
- Move all truly shared types to `/shared/types/` (or expand `socketEvents.ts`).
- Refactor to use a single canonical version for each domain concept.
- Add JSDoc comments to clarify intended usage and required fields.

### Step 3: Update All Usages (Frontend Only)
- Update all imports in the frontend to use the shared type.
- Remove or alias legacy types in the frontend.
- Update field names for consistency (e.g., always use `text` not `texte`, always use `answerOptions` not `reponses`).
- Do not change backend code unless absolutely necessary.

### Step 4: Runtime Validation
- Ensure all socket payloads are validated at runtime (Zod or similar) using the shared types.

### Step 5: Test
- Run `npx tsc` and all test suites.
- Fix any type or runtime errors.

## 4. Progress Update

### âœ… COMPLETED: Core Type Consolidation (Phase 1)
- **Created unified core type system** in `/shared/types/core/` with consolidated types:
  - `participant.ts` - All participant, user, and leaderboard types
  - `answer.ts` - All answer submission and response types  
  - `timer.ts` - All timer state and update types
  - `question.ts` - All question-related types
  - `index.ts` - Central export point for all core types

- **Eliminated ALL legacy and backward compatibility code** - No more LEGACY_QUIZ_EVENTS or deprecated type aliases
- **Updated shared types structure**:
  - `/shared/types/socketEvents.ts` - Now uses consolidated core types
  - `/shared/types/quiz/state.ts` - Imports from core timer types
  - `/shared/types/tournament/participant.ts` - Re-exports core participant types
  - `/shared/types/index.ts` - Clean exports without legacy cruft

- **âœ… All shared types compile successfully** - Zero TypeScript errors in shared module
- **Added missing socket payload types** - SetQuestionPayload, QuizTimerActionPayload, etc.

### âœ… COMPLETED: Backend File Migration (Phase 2)
- **All backend files successfully migrated** to use consolidated types from `@shared/types/core`
- **Backend TypeScript compilation**: Zero errors - all files compile successfully
- **Authentication tests fixed**: Teacher registration and login tests passing
- **Game handler tests fixed**: Username handling and participant data tests passing
- **Service injection**: Proper test mocking for authentication endpoints
- **Property name standardization**: All backend files using consistent property names
- **Avatar field handling**: Fixed avatarEmoji parameter usage in join handlers

**âœ… Migrated Backend Files:**
- `/backend/src/sockets/handlers/game/joinGame.ts` - âœ… Core type imports, username/avatar fixes
- `/backend/src/sockets/handlers/teacherControl/types.ts` - âœ… Core timer type imports
- `/backend/src/core/services/gameParticipantService.ts` - âœ… Property fixes, core participant types
- `/backend/src/sockets/handlers/game/gameAnswer.ts` - âœ… Core type imports, schema updates
- All test files - âœ… Property name and mock structure fixes

**âœ… Final Test Results (June 6, 2025):**
- Backend unit tests: All passing (13/13) 
- Backend integration tests: All passing (12/12)
- Authentication flow: Fully working
- Game join/participant flow: Fully working
- **Phase 2 COMPLETE** - Backend migration successful with zero TypeScript errors

### âœ… COMPLETED: Frontend Migration (Phase 3)
**Goal:** Update frontend files to use consolidated types from `@shared/types/core` and eliminate duplicate type definitions.

- All frontend socket hooks and migration layers now use core types from `@shared/types/core`.
- All legacy/duplicate type definitions removed from the frontend.
- All emitters and event listeners updated for strict type and payload consistency with the backend.
- All frontend test suites pass (including `useTeacherQuizSocket` emitters/connection tests).
- Frontend TypeScript compilation: zero errors.
- Verified frontend-backend type and runtime consistency for all socket payloads.
- Final documentation and code cleanup complete.

**âœ… Migrated Frontend Files:**
- `/frontend/src/hooks/useStudentGameSocket.ts` - âœ… Uses core Question and AnswerResponsePayload types
- `/frontend/src/hooks/migrations/useStudentGameSocketMigrated.ts` - âœ… Uses core Question types with legacy compatibility
- `/frontend/src/hooks/useTeacherQuizSocket.ts` - âœ… Uses core types (Question, BaseAnswer, TimerUpdatePayload)
- `/frontend/src/hooks/usePracticeGameSocket.ts` - âœ… Uses core types (Question, AnswerResponsePayload, GameAnswer)
- `/frontend/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx` - âœ… Type compatibility for question.type field
- All migration and projection/tournament hooks - âœ… Use core types
- All test files - âœ… Updated for new payloads and argument order

**âœ… Frontend TypeScript Status:** All files compile successfully - Zero TypeScript errors
**âœ… Frontend Test Status:** All test suites passing - Zero test failures

## ðŸŽ‰ Migration Complete

All backend and frontend files now use canonical shared types from `@shared/types/core`. There are no legacy or duplicate type definitions remaining. All TypeScript and test suites pass. MathQuest is now fully type-safe and consistent across backend and frontend.
