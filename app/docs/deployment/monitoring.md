# Monitoring & Maintenance Guide

This guide covers best practices for monitoring, logging, and maintaining the MathQuest application in production.

## 1. Logging
- Use a structured logger (e.g., Winston or pino) in the backend.
- Log all errors, warnings, and important events.
- Store logs centrally (e.g., cloud logging, Loggly, Papertrail).
- Rotate and archive logs regularly.

## 2. Error Tracking
- Integrate an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) for backend and frontend.
- Set up alerts for critical errors and exceptions.
- Track and resolve recurring issues.

## 3. Performance Metrics
- Monitor server CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- Track API response times and error rates.
- Use APM tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) for deeper insights.

## 4. Health Checks
- Implement `/health` endpoints in backend for uptime monitoring.
- Use external uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom).
- Set up alerts for downtime or degraded performance.

## 5. Database Monitoring
- Monitor PostgreSQL health, slow queries, and connection counts.
- Set up automated backups and test restores regularly.

## 6. Security Monitoring
- Enable dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., GitHub Dependabot).
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
