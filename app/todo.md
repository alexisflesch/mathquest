A few things need to be fixed on the UI.

3. When, on live/[code] page, a student clicks on an answer too late, it still selects his answer (and shows the error message). I think it should go back to previously selected answer (if any) or unselect everything if none was selected before. Currently it selects the too-late answer, which is not very logical.

4. On live/[code] page, if a student joins after during the phase where the answer is shown, it should give the same view as if he had not answered at all. Right now, the student don't see the correct answer.
