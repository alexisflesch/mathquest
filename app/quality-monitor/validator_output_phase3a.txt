\n💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
\n1. 🔴 HIGH: Add Zod validation to 7 socket handlers
   Socket handlers should validate incoming payloads with Zod schemas
   Action: Import and use appropriate Zod schemas from @shared/types/socketEvents.zod
\n2. 🟡 MEDIUM: Replace 126 hardcoded event names
   Use SOCKET_EVENTS constants instead of hardcoded strings
   Action: Import SOCKET_EVENTS from @shared/types/socket/events and use constants
\n3. 🔴 HIGH: Convert 97 local types to shared types
   Socket payloads should use canonical shared types
   Action: Replace local interface definitions with imports from @shared/types
