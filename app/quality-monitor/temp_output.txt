\n💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
\n1. 🟡 MEDIUM: Replace 126 hardcoded event names
   Use SOCKET_EVENTS constants instead of hardcoded strings
   Action: Import SOCKET_EVENTS from @shared/types/socket/events and use constants
\n2. 🔴 HIGH: Convert 89 local types to shared types
   Socket payloads should use canonical shared types
   Action: Replace local interface definitions with imports from @shared/types
