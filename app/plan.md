# MathQuest App Modernization Plan

**Date**: June 14, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Phase 7 - Practice Mode Architecture Modernization  
**Status**: üöÄ **ACTIVE**

## üéØ **OVERALL MODERNIZATION OBJECTIVE**

Transform MathQuest from legacy code patterns to a modern, type-safe, maintainable application following zero backward compatibility and canonical shared types policies.

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED PHASES**

### **Phase 6: Type Safety & Contract Enforcement** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **6A**: Backend Type Consolidation - All backend types unified with shared definitions
- [x] **6B**: Frontend State Management Unification - All hooks and components use shared types  
- [x] **6C**: Shared Type Enhancement - Mandatory fields implemented, fallback patterns eliminated

## üöß **ACTIVE PHASE: Phase 7 - Practice Mode Architecture Modernization**
