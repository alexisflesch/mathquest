# App Modernization Plan

## Current Phase: Filter System Debug and Fix

### üéØ Main Goal
Fix filter system in teacher games creation page, ensuring consistent API contracts and proper data flow.

## üìã Current Task Checklist

### Phase 1: Filter System Investigation and Fix
- [x] Investigate mobile question list visibility issue (COMPLETED)
- [x] Fix horizontal scrollbar issues in question components (COMPLETED) 
- [x] Fix "Voir mes activit√©s" button text wrapping (COMPLETED)
- [x] Enable drag-and-drop in mobile cart (COMPLETED)
- [x] Fix QuestionDisplay component cropping for titles (COMPLETED)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Fix "Niveaux" filter not working - API parameter mismatch (FIXED: API returns `gradeLevel` not `levels`)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Test "Niveaux" filter functionality after fix
- [ ] **CURRENT**: Investigate and fix other filter issues
- [ ] Validate all filters work correctly
- [ ] Test filter combinations
- [ ] Update documentation with filter API contracts

### Exit Criteria for Phase 1
- All filter dropdowns show data and work correctly
- API requests use correct parameter names matching backend expectations
- Filter combinations work as expected
- No console errors related to filtering

## üîç Current Issue Analysis

**Problem**: "Niveaux" filter dropdown shows nothing when clicked
**Root Cause**: API parameter name mismatch - frontend sends `gradeLevel` but backend might expect different field name
**Next Steps**: 
1. Check backend API contract for correct parameter names
2. Debug API response for filters endpoint
3. Ensure frontend-backend field name consistency

## Phase 3: Filter System Modernization ‚úì COMPLETED

### Filter Field Standardization ‚úì
- [x] Updated all filter logic to use only canonical field names (gradeLevel, not levels/niveaux)
- [x] Removed all legacy/fallback field mappings
- [x] Updated API request parameters to use canonical names
- [x] Fixed "Niveaux" filter dropdown functionality

### Dynamic Filter Cascading ‚úì
- [x] **NEW FEATURE**: Implemented dynamic filter cascading
- [x] Backend: Extended `/api/v1/questions/filters` endpoint to support theme/author parameters
- [x] Backend: Enhanced `getAvailableFilters()` with full cascading logic
- [x] Frontend: Dynamic filter loading based on current selections
- [x] Frontend: Fixed infinite loop issue with useEffect dependencies
- [x] **RESULT**: When user selects gradeLevel, other filters show only compatible options

### Filter Validation ‚úì
- [x] Verified filters work correctly with canonical field names
- [x] Tested filter combinations and cascading behavior
- [x] Confirmed questions update properly when filters change

### Cart Layout UX Fix ‚úì
- [x] **FIXED**: Cart questions pushing input/button to bottom of page
- [x] Changed cart to grow naturally up to max-height (384px)
- [x] Added scrollbar when content exceeds maximum height
- [x] Activity name input and save button always visible at bottom
- [x] **RESULT**: Better UX - users can always access save functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Validate all functionality works end-to-end
2. **Documentation**: Update API documentation if needed
3. **Performance**: Monitor filter response times with large datasets
