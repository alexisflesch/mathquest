# MathQuest M#### Investigation Items:
- [x] Analyze current socket authentication middleware for guest handling
- [x] Review tournament join flow for guest users  
- [x] Identify where authentication requirement is incorrectly enforced for guests
- [x] Fix authentication logic to allow guest participation in tournaments

#### Implementation:
- [x] Updated `lobbyHandler.ts` to support guest users by falling back to payload data
- [x] Modified user details extraction to use `socket.data.user` OR payload for guests
- [x] Ensured avatar emoji fallback works correctly for guest users
- [x] Verified TypeScript compilation passes in all moduleson Plan

## CURRENT PHASE: Tournament Guest Authentication Bug Fix

### Phase 8: Fix Tournament Guest Authentication and Timer Synchronization
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL COMPLETION - TESTING REQUIRED**
**Goal**: Fix guest authentication in tournament mode and timer sync for late joiners

#### Problem Description:
- [x] User creates tournament, gets redirected to lobby (✅ works)
- [x] **FIXED**: Guest users from another browser get error "Erreur: User details not available. Ensure client is authenticated" when trying to join tournament
- [x] Guests should be allowed to play tournaments without authentication  
- [x] **FIXED**: "Invalid leaveLobby payload" error when clicking "Démarrer"
- [x] **IDENTIFIED**: Timer synchronization issue - late joiners get incorrect starting time (20s instead of actual remaining time)

#### Investigation Items:
- [x] Analyze current socket authentication middleware for guest handling
- [x] Review tournament join flow for guest users
- [x] Identify where authentication requirement is incorrectly enforced for guests
- [x] Fix authentication logic to allow guest participation in tournaments

#### Implementation:
- [x] Updated `lobbyHandler.ts` to support guest users by falling back to payload data
- [x] Modified user details extraction to use `socket.data.user` OR payload for guests
- [x] Ensured avatar emoji fallback works correctly for guest users
- [x] Fixed `leaveLobbyPayloadSchema` to make `userId` optional (guests don't need it)
- [x] Fixed frontend leave lobby calls to use correct `accessCode` property
- [x] Updated `LiveQuestionPayload` type to include full `GameTimerState` instead of just duration number
- [x] Added timer synchronization in `game_question` handler for late joiners
- [x] Fixed `useUnifiedGameManager` to extract duration from `GameTimerState` object
- [x] Verified TypeScript compilation passes in shared/ and backend/ modules
- [ ] **PENDING**: Fix test files that expect timer to be number instead of GameTimerState

#### Known Issues:
- [ ] **Test Compilation Errors**: Multiple test files expect `timer: number` but now need `timer: GameTimerState`
- [ ] **Testing Required**: Manual verification that timer sync works for late joiners
- [ ] **Question 1/n**: not working as expected, needs further investigation
- [ ] **Timer**: Ensure correct rounding : if joining with 15.5s, write 15 for 0.5s then normal countdown.


#### Expected Fix:
- [x] Guests should be able to join tournaments using username/avatar from localStorage
- [x] No authentication token should be required for guest tournament participation
- [x] Tournament lobby should accept guest connections

#### Success Criteria & Testing Plan:
**TESTING SETUP:**
1. **Start Development Servers**: `npm run dev` (runs both frontend:3000 and backend:5000)
2. **Browser Setup**: Use two different browsers or incognito tabs to simulate different users

**TEST SCENARIOS:**
- [ ] **Test 1 - Tournament Creation**: Create tournament as authenticated user, verify lobby loads
- [ ] **Test 2 - Guest Join Success**: Open different browser, join as guest, verify no authentication errors
- [ ] **Test 3 - Guest Participation**: Guest sees participant list, can receive game start notifications
- [ ] **Test 4 - Mixed User Types**: Both authenticated and guest users in same tournament lobby
- [ ] **Test 5 - Game Flow**: Tournament progresses normally with guest participants

**VALIDATION STEPS:**
1. **Terminal 1**: `cd /home/aflesch/mathquest/app && npm run dev` 
2. **Browser 1** (Creator): Go to http://localhost:3000, create tournament, note access code
3. **Browser 2** (Guest): Go to http://localhost:3000, join with access code as guest
4. **Expected**: Guest joins successfully without "User details not available" error
5. **Check Backend Logs**: Should show successful guest authentication from payload

**PASS CRITERIA:**
- [x] ✅ Code implementation complete
- [ ] ❌ No "User details not available" error for guests  
- [ ] ❌ Guest appears in lobby participant list
- [ ] ❌ Guest receives game start notifications
- [ ] ❌ Backend logs show guest authentication source as 'payload'

#### Implementation Complete:
- [x] Updated `lobbyHandler.ts` to support both authenticated and guest users
- [x] Handler now checks payload for `userId`, `username`, `avatarEmoji` when `socket.data.user` is not available
- [x] Improved error messaging to guide guest users on required payload fields
- [x] Updated participant creation to use fallback values from payload
