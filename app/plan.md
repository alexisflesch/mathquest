## CURRENT PHASE: Critical Tournament Game State Sync Issues ÔøΩ

### Phase 10: Fix Tournament Question/Answer Sync and Socket Validation Issues  
**Status**: ÔøΩ **CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED**
**Goal**: Fix question synchronization and answer validation bugs causing incorrect game behavior

#### Critical Issues Identified from Live Testing:
1. **üö® BACKEND BUG**: Backend sends `index` but shared types expect `questionIndex` in `game_question` events
2. **Socket Validation Failures**: Frontend rejects backend payloads due to field name mismatches  
3. **Question Index Mismatch**: Frontend shows "Question 1/2" but backend processes question 2 (TEST-add-2)
4. **Answer Validation Failure**: `answer_received` event payload validation fails in frontend
5. **Incorrect Answer Display**: User answers correctly (2+2=4, index 0) but system shows wrong answer
6. **Backend Question Confusion**: Backend logs show mixed question UIDs (TEST-add-1 vs TEST-add-2)

#### Root Cause:
The backend violates shared type contracts by sending non-standard field names, causing frontend validation to reject critical state updates. Multiple backend handlers emit `game_question` with inconsistent field names.

#### Fixes Applied:
- [x] **Backend Field Name Fix**: Changed `index` to `questionIndex` in `sharedGameFlow.ts` 
- [x] **Backend Field Name Fix**: Changed `index` to `questionIndex` in `joinGame.ts` (late joiner fix)
- [x] **Backend Field Name Fix**: Changed `index` to `questionIndex` in `helpers.ts` (practice mode fix)
- [x] **Frontend Type Guard Fix**: Updated validation to accept `feedbackWaitTime` and object timer
- [x] **Socket Event Type Safety**: Fixed `answer_received` validation to only require mandatory fields
- [x] **üö® AUTONOMOUS FEEDBACK FIX**: Removed frontend autonomous feedback using question explanation
- [x] **Feedback Fallback Fix**: Changed fallback message to "R√©ponse enregistr√©e" instead of "Temps √©coul√©"
- [x] **Answer Received Snackbar**: Added success snackbar showing "R√©ponse enregistr√©e" on answer submission
- [x] **Snackbar Auto-Hide**: Added 2-second auto-hide timer for snackbars
- [x] **üö® Feedback Auto-Close Fix**: Removed auto-close timer from `AnswerFeedbackOverlay` component
- [x] **Feedback Duration Fix**: Duration now only controls progress bar animation, not overlay closure
- [x] **üö® Type Guard Validation Fix**: Fixed `filterQuestionForClient` to convert `null` explanation to `undefined`
- [x] **Frontend Question Display Fix**: Corrected question 2 not appearing due to type validation failure

#### Socket Event Type Safety (Completed):
- [x] Identified backend emits `game_ended` event with `{ accessCode, endedAt }` payload
- [x] Replaced `tournament_finished_redirect` listener with proper `game_ended` listener  
- [x] Updated navigation logic to use `game_ended` event payload
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes

#### Investigation Plan:
- [ ] Check question index calculation in frontend vs backend
- [ ] Fix `answer_received` event payload validation 
- [ ] Verify question UID consistency between frontend/backend
- [ ] Test answer submission and feedback display accuracy

### Phase 9: Fix Tournament Timer, Redirection, and Debug Overlay Issues ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Fix three critical tournament mode bugs affecting user experience

#### Fixed Issues:
- [x] **Timer Display**: Fixed `formatTimer` function in `TournamentTimer.tsx` to show "0" instead of "-" when timer reaches zero
- [x] **Leaderboard Redirection**: üö® **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE FIX** - Removed frontend autonomous redirect, added proper backend event listener
- [x] **Debug Overlay**: Removed persistent development debug overlay stuck in lower left corner from live game page
- [x] **Feedback Control**: Fixed frontend auto-hiding feedback, now controlled by backend phases

#### üö® Critical Architecture Discovery & Fix:
- **Problem**: Frontend was making autonomous decisions (redirects, feedback hiding) instead of waiting for backend signals
- **Solution**: Frontend now properly listens to backend events (`tournament_finished_redirect`) and lets backend control game flow
- **Latest Fix**: Removed autonomous tournament status checking and redirecting in live game page - frontend must wait for backend signals

#### Implementation Details:
- **Timer Fix**: Changed `if (val === null) return '-';` to `if (val === null || val === 0) return '0';` in `TournamentTimer.tsx`
- **Redirection Fix**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR CHANGE** - Removed frontend auto-redirect, added `tournament_finished_redirect` event listener
- **Feedback Fix**: Removed frontend timer that auto-hid feedback overlay, now controlled by backend phase changes
- **Debug Overlay Removal**: Removed development debug display showing "Mode: tournament | Phase: feedback | Status: completed"

#### Files Modified:
- `/frontend/src/components/TournamentTimer.tsx` - Fixed timer display
- `/frontend/src/hooks/useStudentGameSocket.ts` - Fixed leaderboard redirection  
- `/frontend/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx` - Removed debug overlay
- `/plan.md` and `/log.md` - Documentation updates

### Previous Phase: Tournament Guest Authentication and Timer Synchronization
**Goal**: Fix three critical tournament mode issues affecting user experience

#### Problem Description:
1. **Timer Display Bug**: When timer reaches 0, a dash "-" is shown instead of "0" ‚úÖ FIXED
2. **Missing Leaderboard Redirect**: At tournament end, users are not redirected to leaderboard (likely commented out for debugging) ‚úÖ FIXED
3. **Stuck Debug Overlay**: Debug "snackbar" persistently shown in lower left corner displaying tournament mode/phase/status info ‚úÖ FIXED

#### Investigation Items:
- [x] Locate timer display logic in TournamentTimer component and fix dash-at-zero issue
- [x] Find and verify leaderboard redirection is enabled after tournament completion
- [x] Identify and remove persistent debug overlay/snackbar from tournament pages
- [x] Test all fixes in tournament mode to ensure proper behavior

#### Implementation:
- [x] Fix `formatTimer` function in TournamentTimer.tsx to show "0" instead of "-" when timer reaches zero
- [x] Re-enable `tournament_finished_redirect` event handler in frontend live page
- [x] Remove debug status display from tournament UI
- [x] Update plan.md and log.md per modernization instructions before and after each change

#### Success Criteria & Testing Plan:
**Manual Testing Required:**
1. **Timer Display**: Start tournament, wait for timer to reach 0, verify "0" is shown (not "-")
2. **Leaderboard Redirect**: Complete tournament, verify automatic redirect to leaderboard after 3 seconds
3. **Clean UI**: Verify no debug overlay visible in lower left corner during tournament play

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/components/TournamentTimer.tsx` - Fixed timer display
- `/frontend/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx` - Re-enabled redirect & removed debug overlay
- `/plan.md` and `/log.md` - Updated documentation

**Expected Results:**
- Tournament mode provides smooth user experience
- Timer countdown works correctly to zero
- Tournament completion flows naturally to leaderboard
- Clean UI without development artifacts
- [x] **FIXED**: Guest users from another browser get error "Erreur: User details not available. Ensure client is authenticated" when trying to join tournament
- [x] Guests should be allowed to play tournaments without authentication  
- [x] **FIXED**: "Invalid leaveLobby payload" error when clicking "D√©marrer"
- [x] **IDENTIFIED**: Timer synchronization issue - late joiners get incorrect starting time (20s instead of actual remaining time)

#### Investigation Items:
- [x] Analyze current socket authentication middleware for guest handling
- [x] Review tournament join flow for guest users
- [x] Identify where authentication requirement is incorrectly enforced for guests
- [x] Fix authentication logic to allow guest participation in tournaments

#### Implementation:
- [x] Updated `lobbyHandler.ts` to support guest users by falling back to payload data
- [x] Modified user details extraction to use `socket.data.user` OR payload for guests
- [x] Ensured avatar emoji fallback works correctly for guest users
- [x] Fixed `leaveLobbyPayloadSchema` to make `userId` optional (guests don't need it)
- [x] Fixed frontend leave lobby calls to use correct `accessCode` property
- [x] Updated `LiveQuestionPayload` type to include full `GameTimerState` instead of just duration number
- [x] Added timer synchronization in `game_question` handler for late joiners
- [x] Fixed `useUnifiedGameManager` to extract duration from `GameTimerState` object
- [x] Verified TypeScript compilation passes in shared/ and backend/ modules
- [ ] **PENDING**: Fix test files that expect timer to be number instead of GameTimerState

#### Known Issues:
- [ ] **Test Compilation Errors**: Multiple test files expect `timer: number` but now need `timer: GameTimerState`
- [ ] **Testing Required**: Manual verification that timer sync works for late joiners
- [ ] **Question 1/n**: not working as expected, needs further investigation
- [ ] **Timer**: Ensure correct rounding : if joining with 15.5s, write 15 for 0.5s then normal countdown.


#### Expected Fix:
- [x] Guests should be able to join tournaments using username/avatar from localStorage
- [x] No authentication token should be required for guest tournament participation
- [x] Tournament lobby should accept guest connections

#### Success Criteria & Testing Plan:
**TESTING SETUP:**
1. **Start Development Servers**: `npm run dev` (runs both frontend:3000 and backend:5000)
2. **Browser Setup**: Use two different browsers or incognito tabs to simulate different users

**TEST SCENARIOS:**
- [ ] **Test 1 - Tournament Creation**: Create tournament as authenticated user, verify lobby loads
- [ ] **Test 2 - Guest Join Success**: Open different browser, join as guest, verify no authentication errors
- [ ] **Test 3 - Guest Participation**: Guest sees participant list, can receive game start notifications
- [ ] **Test 4 - Mixed User Types**: Both authenticated and guest users in same tournament lobby
- [ ] **Test 5 - Game Flow**: Tournament progresses normally with guest participants

**VALIDATION STEPS:**
1. **Terminal 1**: `cd /home/aflesch/mathquest/app && npm run dev` 
2. **Browser 1** (Creator): Go to http://localhost:3000, create tournament, note access code
3. **Browser 2** (Guest): Go to http://localhost:3000, join with access code as guest
4. **Expected**: Guest joins successfully without "User details not available" error
5. **Check Backend Logs**: Should show successful guest authentication from payload

**PASS CRITERIA:**
- [x] ‚úÖ Code implementation complete
- [ ] ‚ùå No "User details not available" error for guests  
- [ ] ‚ùå Guest appears in lobby participant list
- [ ] ‚ùå Guest receives game start notifications
- [ ] ‚ùå Backend logs show guest authentication source as 'payload'

#### Implementation Complete:
- [x] Updated `lobbyHandler.ts` to support both authenticated and guest users
- [x] Handler now checks payload for `userId`, `username`, `avatarEmoji` when `socket.data.user` is not available
- [x] Improved error messaging to guide guest users on required payload fields
- [x] Updated participant creation to use fallback values from payload
