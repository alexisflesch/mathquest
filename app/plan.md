# Timer Flickering Fix - Hook Optimization Solution ✅ COMPLETED

## Problem Analysis
The draggable timer in `TeacherProjectionClient.tsx` was flickering during drag operations due to:
- Hook updating `timeLeftMs` every **100ms** (projection update interval)
- Timer display only changing every **second** (`Math.floor(timeLeftMs / 1000)`)
- This caused **10 unnecessary hook re-executions per second** with the same visual output
- Even with optimized timer values, the hook was returning new objects every 100ms

## Root Cause Solution Implemented ✅
Fixed at the hook level with comprehensive timer optimization:
1. **Optimized timer value updates**: Only update `optimizedTimeLeftMs` when displayed seconds value actually changes
2. **Optimized timer status updates**: Only update `optimizedTimerStatus` when status actually changes
3. **Memoized hook return value**: Used `useMemo` to prevent new object creation when only timer internals change
4. **Proper dependency management**: Only re-execute when values that affect the display actually change

## Changes Made
- [x] Analyzed root cause: 100ms hook re-executions vs 1-second display changes
- [x] Added `optimizedTimeLeftMs` and `optimizedTimerStatus` states in `useProjectionQuizSocket` hook
- [x] Implemented seconds-based change detection logic with proper refs to track changes
- [x] Wrapped return value with `useMemo` and optimized dependencies
- [x] Used optimized timer values in hook return instead of raw timer state
- [x] Reduced hook re-executions from 10/second to 1/second
- [x] Fixed syntax errors in `useMemo` structure
- [x] Removed excessive debug logging
- [x] Preserved all original functionality and styling

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Start the frontend development server
2. Navigate to a teacher projection page with an active timer
3. Check console - should see logs only once per second instead of 10x per second
4. Drag the timer element - no flickering should occur
5. Verify timer updates normally every second when not dragging
6. Verify resize and all other functionality works correctly

## Expected Behavior ✅
- Hook executes only when display value changes (once per second)
- No console spam (90% reduction in log messages)
- No flickering during drag operations
- All existing functionality preserved
- Significant performance improvement throughout the entire rendering pipeline

## Technical Details
The fix specifically addresses the timer update frequency by:
- Extracting current timer values to avoid dependencies on entire timer object
- Using refs to track previous values and only update when necessary
- Implementing proper change detection for both time and status
- Using `useMemo` with precise dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders

This solution targets the root cause (timer updates every 100ms) while maintaining all functionality and improving performance across the entire component tree.
