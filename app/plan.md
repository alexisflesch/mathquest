# üéØ CRITICAL BUG: Leaderboard Modernization

## üö® ACTIVE ISSUE: Redis Data Corruption on User Rejoin

**PROBLEM**: When a user refreshes their live page, their Redis score gets reset to 0, corrupting the leaderboard for all users (both projection and live rooms).

**ROOT CAUSE**: `joinGameHandler` overwrites Redis participant data with database scores (which are 0 during active gameplay).

**IMPACT**: 
- ‚úÖ Redis is source of truth during gameplay (correct)
- ‚ùå Database scores are 0 until game ends (correct)
- ‚ùå User rejoin corrupts Redis with 0 scores (BUG)

---

## PHASE 1: Fix Redis Corruption Bug

### Current Status
- [x] Added `leaderboard` property to `StudentGameUIState` and event handler
- [x] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors 
- [x] Both projection and live rooms use Redis data (`calculateLeaderboard()`)
- [x] üö® **CRITICAL**: Fixed `joinGameHandler` to preserve Redis scores on rejoin
- [x] üö® **CRITICAL**: Fixed `calculateLeaderboard()` to use leaderboard sorted set as source of truth
- [x] üö® **CRITICAL**: Fixed participant data corruption on rejoin (score accumulation issue)

### Latest Fix (2025-07-10)
The core issue was two-fold:
1. **Source of Truth**: `calculateLeaderboard()` was reading from participant data instead of leaderboard sorted set
2. **Score Accumulation**: On user rejoin, participant data was being overwritten with database score (0), causing score replacement instead of accumulation

**Fixed**:
- ‚úÖ Updated `calculateLeaderboard()` to use leaderboard sorted set (live scores) as source of truth
- ‚úÖ Updated `joinGameHandler` to preserve BOTH leaderboard and participant data scores on rejoin
- ‚úÖ Updated all emission points to use snapshot-based emission for consistency

### Required Fix
```typescript
// In joinGameHandler.ts - PRESERVE existing Redis scores when user rejoins
if (existingRedisData && existingRedisData.score > 0) {
    // Preserve live game score from Redis
    finalScore = existingRedisData.score;
} else {
    // Use database score for new joins
    finalScore = databaseScore;
}
```

### Testing Plan
1. Start game, submit answers (verify scores > 0 in Redis)  
2. Refresh live page ‚Üí scores should remain the same (not reset to 0)
3. Refresh projection page ‚Üí should show same scores as live room

---

## PHASE 2: Validate Leaderboard Consistency

### Backend Emission Points (All using Redis)
- [x] `joinGameHandler`: Uses `calculateLeaderboard(accessCode)` ‚Üí Redis ‚úÖ
- [x] `revealLeaderboardHandler`: Uses `calculateLeaderboard(accessCode)` ‚Üí Redis ‚úÖ  
- [x] Projection room: Uses `calculateLeaderboard(accessCode)` ‚Üí Redis ‚úÖ

### Frontend Reception
- [x] Live room: Listens for `leaderboard_update` event ‚úÖ
- [x] Projection room: Uses projection-specific events ‚úÖ

## üîç DISCOVERY: Snapshot Architecture Purpose

**ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT**: The snapshot mechanism serves two critical purposes:

### 1. **Lobby Population**
- Users can join the lobby and see existing leaderboard
- No interference with live gameplay during questions

### 2. **Late Joiner Support**  
- Users can join mid-question without corrupting live leaderboard
- Scores are added to snapshot but not live leaderboard until question ends

### Redis Storage Locations & Purpose
1. **`mathquest:game:participants:{accessCode}`** ‚Üí Live participant data with real-time scores
2. **`mathquest:game:leaderboard:{accessCode}`** ‚Üí Sorted set for live leaderboard calculations
3. **`leaderboard:snapshot:{accessCode}`** ‚Üí Snapshot for lobby/late-joiners (isolated from live)

### Data Flow Design
- **Live Gameplay**: Uses live Redis data (`participants` & `leaderboard`)
- **Lobby/Late-Joiners**: Uses snapshot data (doesn't affect live until question ends)
- **Question End**: Snapshot merges into live data

### üéØ ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH: Snapshot System Purpose

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: The snapshot system is **NOT** for data consistency - it's for **lobby population** and **late joiners**!

#### Snapshot System Design Intent
- **Lobby Phase**: Snapshot allows users to see who joined before game starts
- **Late Joiners**: Users can join mid-game without corrupting live leaderboard
- **Live Gameplay**: Only live Redis participants data matters for active scoring
- **Score Updates**: Live participants get updated, snapshot remains static until sync

#### The Root Cause Bug
- **CORRECT**: Snapshot should only be used for lobby/late-joiners
- **BUG**: `joinGameHandler` overwrites live Redis scores with snapshot/database data (0 scores)
- **IMPACT**: Live gameplay scores get corrupted when users rejoin during active game

### Current Issue
- **Corruption Point**: `joinGameHandler` overwrites live Redis with database scores (0)
- **Expected**: Should use snapshot for late-joiners, preserve live data for existing users
- **Bug**: No distinction between "new lobby join" vs "mid-game rejoin"

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Redis Documentation

### Redis Scoring Storage System Documentation
- [x] **Added comprehensive Redis documentation** to `/docs/architecture/overview.md`
- [x] **Documented Redis key structure**: `participants`, `leaderboard`, `snapshot`
- [x] **Explained architectural purpose** of each Redis storage location
- [x] **Detailed data flow** for lobby, active game, and game end phases
- [x] **Join type handling** for new joins, late joins, and rejoins
- [x] **Critical implementation rules** and anti-patterns to avoid
- [x] **Canonical payload format** requirements for all emissions

### Documentation Location
File: `/docs/architecture/overview.md` ‚Üí Database Architecture ‚Üí Redis Scoring Storage System

This documentation will prevent future confusion about the Redis data architecture and ensure proper implementation of leaderboard features.

---

## NEXT STEPS

### 1. **Implement Robust Join Type Detection**
- **Fix**: Update `joinGameHandler` to distinguish between:
  - **New lobby join**: Use database score (0) and add to snapshot
  - **Late joiner**: Add to snapshot only, don't affect live leaderboard
  - **Mid-game rejoin**: Preserve existing live Redis scores, don't overwrite

### 2. **Systematic Testing Protocol**
- **Clean State**: Start with fresh game, no Redis data
- **Score Test**: Submit answers, verify both Redis locations update
- **Live Rejoin**: Refresh live page, verify scores preserved
- **Projection Sync**: Verify projection room shows same scores as live

### 3. **Validate Architecture**
- **Snapshot Isolation**: Ensure snapshot never overwrites live data
- **Late Joiner Flow**: Test mid-game join without affecting live leaderboard
- **Lobby Population**: Verify lobby shows participants before game starts

## BLOCKERS RESOLVED
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified**: Snapshot system architectural purpose understood
- ‚úÖ **Data Flow Mapped**: Live vs snapshot data sources clarified
- **Next**: Implement robust join type detection in `joinGameHandler`
# PHASE: CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Leaderboard Emission Timing (2025-07-09)

## üö® SECURITY VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED

**EXPLOIT**: Tournament mode sends leaderboard updates immediately after each answer submission, allowing students to determine answer correctness before the timer expires.

**ATTACK VECTOR**: Submit answer ‚Üí Observe leaderboard change ‚Üí Change answer if no score increase

**AFFECTED FILE**: `/backend/src/sockets/handlers/game/gameAnswer.ts` (lines 377-378)

---

## IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### 1. **REMOVE INSECURE LEADERBOARD EMISSION** ‚úÖ

**Target**: `gameAnswer.ts:377-378`
```typescript
// ‚úÖ REMOVED SECURITY VULNERABILITY:
// logger.info({ leaderboard, roomName }, 'Emitting leaderboard_update to room');
// io.to(roomName).emit(SOCKET_EVENTS.GAME.LEADERBOARD_UPDATE as any, { leaderboard });
```

**Action**: 
- [x] Remove leaderboard emission from individual answer processing
- [x] Add comment explaining security rationale
- [x] Ensure leaderboard is only calculated but NOT emitted

### 2. **ADD SECURE LEADERBOARD EMISSION** ‚úÖ

**Target**: `sharedGameFlow.ts` after `correct_answers` event

**Current Flow (CORRECT)**:
```
Question ‚Üí Timer ‚Üí Correct Answers ‚Üí [LEADERBOARD HERE] ‚Üí Feedback ‚Üí Next Question
```

**Implementation**:
- [x] Add leaderboard calculation and emission in `sharedGameFlow.ts` 
- [x] Emit after `correct_answers` event but before `feedback` event
- [x] Use existing `calculateLeaderboard()` function
- [x] Target room: `game_${accessCode}` (tournament participants)

### 3. **TIMING VERIFICATION** ‚úÖ

**Requirements**:
- [x] Leaderboard NEVER emitted during answer submission  
- [x] Leaderboard ONLY emitted after question timer expires
- [x] Leaderboard emitted for both quiz and tournament modes
- [x] Maintain existing projection/dashboard leaderboard emissions

### 4. **FRONTEND VERIFICATION** ‚úÖ

**Requirements**:
- [x] Add `leaderboard_update` event listener to `useStudentGameSocket.ts`
- [x] Log leaderboard reception for testing/debugging
- [ ] Create leaderboard state management (future phase)
- [ ] Create leaderboard UI components (future phase)

### 5. **QUIZ MODE MANUAL LEADERBOARD** ‚úÖ

**Issue Discovered**: Quiz mode teacher trophy button didn't emit leaderboard to students
**Root Cause**: `revealLeaderboardHandler.ts` only emitted to projection room, not student room
**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Add student leaderboard emission to `revealLeaderboardHandler.ts`
- [x] Emit to `game_${accessCode}` room when teacher clicks trophy
- [x] Use same `calculateLeaderboard()` function for consistency
- [x] Add proper logging for quiz mode manual leaderboard triggers

### 6. **LEADERBOARD ON PAGE LOAD** ‚úÖ

**Use Cases**: Late joiners, reconnections, page reloads, network disconnections
**Edge Cases Handled**:
- [x] Game not started yet (`pending`) ‚Üí Skip leaderboard emission
- [x] Game started, no questions completed ‚Üí Send leaderboard with 0 scores 
- [x] Game in progress ‚Üí Send current leaderboard state
- [x] Game completed ‚Üí Send final leaderboard
- [x] No participants ‚Üí Send empty leaderboard array
**Implementation**:
- [x] Add leaderboard emission to `joinGame.ts` after `GAME_JOINED` event
- [x] Use same `calculateLeaderboard()` function for consistency
- [x] Emit only for `active` or `completed` games, skip `pending`
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging

---

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### **Step 1: Security Vulnerability Removed** ‚úÖ

**File**: `gameAnswer.ts:377-378`
- ‚úÖ Removed immediate leaderboard emission after answer submission
- ‚úÖ Added security comment explaining the vulnerability
- ‚úÖ Preserved answer_received emission (harmless)

### **Step 2: Secure Leaderboard Emission Added** ‚úÖ

**File**: `sharedGameFlow.ts` (after line 211)
- ‚úÖ Added leaderboard emission after `correct_answers` event
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Only emits when participants exist
- ‚úÖ Uses existing `calculateLeaderboard()` function

### **Step 3: Testing Required** üß™

- [ ] **Security Test**: Verify no leaderboard updates during answer submission
- [ ] **Timing Test**: Confirm leaderboard only appears after timer expires  
- [ ] **Functional Test**: Verify leaderboards still work correctly for legitimate use
- [ ] **Quiz Mode Test**: Ensure quiz mode leaderboard behavior is preserved

---

## NEXT PHASE: FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION 

The backend security fix is **complete**. However, the frontend still needs to:

1. **Add Leaderboard Event Listener** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Add `leaderboard_update` listener to `useStudentGameSocket.ts`
   - Handle leaderboard state management
   - Show current user's score and rank

2. **UI Components** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)  
   - Create leaderboard display widgets
   - Show during tournament between questions
   - Add current user highlighting

3. **Quiz Mode Enhancement** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Backend already supports quiz leaderboards
   - Frontend can reuse tournament implementation

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**BEFORE FIX**: üî¥ **CRITICAL VULNERABILITY**
- Students could cheat by observing real-time score changes
- Tournament competitive integrity completely compromised

**AFTER FIX**: üü¢ **SECURE** 
- ‚úÖ Leaderboards only shown after question timer expires
- ‚úÖ No way to determine answer correctness during submission
- ‚úÖ Maintains proper competitive integrity
- ‚úÖ All legitimate functionality preserved

---

# PHASE: Participant List Update Bug Fix - Creator Preservation (2025-07-09)

## Context

**CRITICAL BUG**: When the creator leaves a tournament/quiz, the participant list stops being emitted to remaining participants because the `emitParticipantList` function was looking for the creator in the participants list and returning early when not found.

**Key Issue**: For quiz mode, the creator will NOT be in the live room participants list, so this logic was fundamentally flawed.

## Expected Behavior

- Creator information (username/avatar) must always be available for display
- Participant list updates must always be emitted, regardless of creator presence
- Creator leaving should not break participant list updates for remaining users

---

## Phase 1: Fix Participant List Logic ‚úÖ

- [x] **FIXED**: Remove logic that returns early when creator not found in participants
- [x] **CREATOR PRESERVATION**: Always fetch creator info from database, independent of participants
- [x] **QUIZ MODE SUPPORT**: Creator info available even when not in participants list
- [x] **EMIT GUARANTEE**: Participant list always emitted as long as game instance exists
- [x] **NULL SAFETY**: Added null check for initiatorUserId to prevent type errors

---

## Phase 2: Testing & Validation

- [ ] **Test Tournament**: Creator leaves ‚Üí verify participant list updates for remaining users
- [ ] **Test Quiz Mode**: Creator not in participants ‚Üí verify creator info still displayed
- [ ] **Test Empty Participants**: No participants left ‚Üí verify graceful handling
- [ ] **Test Creator Display**: Live page shows creator username/avatar correctly

---

## Phase 3: Documentation

- [ ] Document the creator preservation logic
- [ ] Update socket event documentation
- [ ] Verify all related tests pass

---

# PREVIOUS PHASES

## PHASE: Timer Edit Logic Fix - Immediate TimeLeft Changes with Fair Penalties (2025-07-09)

## Context

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: When editing a running timer, the teacher wants to immediately change the remaining time (`timeLeftMs`), not restart or change the full duration. However, elapsed time must still be preserved for fair penalty calculations.

**Key Concepts**:
- `durationMs` = Full duration of the question (canonical reference)
- `timeLeftMs` = Current remaining time (what teacher is editing)
- `timerEndDateMs` = When timer will expire (now + timeLeftMs)

## Expected Behavior

When editing a running timer:
1. **Immediate Effect**: Set `timerEndDateMs = now + newTimeLeftMs` (takes effect immediately)
2. **Adjust Duration**: Update `durationMs` only if increased to accommodate new time left
3. **Preserve Penalties**: Elapsed time calculation remains accurate for fair penalties

---

## Phase 1: Fix Implementation ‚úÖ

- [x] **FIXED**: Target `timerEndDateMs` directly for immediate effect
- [x] **IMMEDIATE CHANGE**: `timerEndDateMs = now + newTimeLeftMs` (no restart needed)
- [x] **DURATION ADJUSTMENT**: Only increase `durationMs` if new total duration > original
- [x] **PENALTY PRESERVATION**: Elapsed time calculation remains accurate
- [x] **GETIMER LOGIC**: Handle explicitly set `timerEndDateMs` vs computed values

---

## Phase 2: Testing & Validation

- [ ] **Test Immediate Effect**: Edit running timer ‚Üí verify `timeLeftMs` changes immediately
- [ ] **Test Duration Increase**: Edit timer from 30s to 2min ‚Üí verify `durationMs` increases
- [ ] **Test Duration Decrease**: Edit timer from 2min to 30s ‚Üí verify `durationMs` unchanged
- [ ] **Test Penalty Preservation**: 
  - Student A answers at 30s elapsed time
  - Teacher edits remaining time to 2min
  - Student B answers at 45s elapsed time
  - Expected: Student A penalty = 30s, Student B penalty = 45s

---

## Phase 3: Documentation

- [ ] Update timer system documentation to reflect immediate timeLeft changes
- [ ] Document the relationship between `durationMs`, `timeLeftMs`, and `timerEndDateMs`
- [ ] Update any related tests to match the new logic

---

# PHASE: Score Reset Logic by Mode (Tournament vs Quiz) (2025-07-09)

## Context

Currently, the score reset logic in `getOrCreateParticipation` always resets the score and increments attempts on replay, regardless of mode. We want to:
- Keep this logic for tournaments.
- Skip it for quizzes (do not reset score or increment attempts on replay).

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Documentation

- [x] Document the requirement and context in `plan.md`.
- [x] Create a checklist for the implementation phase.

---

## Phase 2: Implementation

- [ ] Update `getOrCreateParticipation` to accept a `mode` parameter (e.g., `"tournament"` or `"quiz"`).
- [ ] Branch logic:
  - [ ] If mode is `"tournament"`, keep current behavior (reset score, increment attempts).
  - [ ] If mode is `"quiz"`, do not reset score or increment attempts on replay.
- [ ] Update all usages of `getOrCreateParticipation` to pass the correct mode.
- [ ] Ensure shared types and Zod schemas reflect the canonical mode values.

---

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Add or update tests to cover both tournament and quiz flows.
- [ ] Document test steps in `plan.md`:
  - [ ] For tournament: replay resets score and increments attempts.
  - [ ] For quiz: replay does not reset score or increment attempts.
- [ ] State expected vs. actual behavior after testing.

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Logging

- [ ] Log all changes in `plan.md` and `log.md`.
- [ ] Update any relevant documentation or diagrams.
- [ ] Ensure all API boundaries and payloads are validated with Zod.

# PHASE: Redis State Modernization ‚Äì Prevent Participant/Score Loss (2025-07-09)

## Context

When replaying or joining a quiz/tournament game, participants and their scores were disappearing from the Redis-based leaderboard and podium, even though the database was correct. Root cause: Redis state was being cleared at game start (and deferred session start), wiping all participants and scores. Redis must only be cleared at game/session end.

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Documentation

- [x] Investigate and confirm root cause (Redis cleanup at game start/session start)
- [x] Identify all locations where Redis is cleared at the start of a game/session
- [x] Update plan.md with checklist and context

---

## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] Remove/comment out Redis cleanup at game start in `sharedGameFlow.ts`
- [x] Remove/comment out Redis cleanup at deferred session start in `deferredTournamentFlow.ts`
- [ ] Log all changes in `plan.md` and `log.md`

---

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test joining/replaying a game: verify all participants and scores persist in Redis throughout the game
- [ ] Validate leaderboard and podium are correct for all users
- [ ] Ensure Redis is only cleared at game/session end
- [ ] Document test steps and results in plan.md

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Logging

- [ ] Update `log.md` with summary of changes and validation steps
- [ ] Ensure all modernization guidelines are followed

---

# PHASE: Frontend Modernization (COMPLETE)

## Context

Update frontend to use new canonical leaderboard payload and remove legacy logic.

## Changes

- [x] Update `/frontend/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx` to use canonical leaderboard payload (`score`, optional `leaderboard`).
- [x] FAB: Show only score if `leaderboard` missing (deferred/practice), show rank+modal if present (quiz/tournament).
- [x] Remove legacy leaderboard logic.
- [x] Validate both modes for correct FAB/modal behavior.
- [x] Update documentation and checklist after frontend changes.

### Log
- 2025-07-10: Updated `/frontend/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx` to consume canonical leaderboard payload from socket (`score`, optional `leaderboard`). FAB now conditionally shows score (deferred/practice) or rank+modal (quiz/tournament). Legacy leaderboard logic removed. All code uses canonical shared types.

### Testing
- [x] Deferred/practice mode: FAB shows only score, no modal, leaderboard is not present in payload.
- [x] Quiz/tournament mode: FAB shows rank, opens modal, leaderboard is present in payload.
- [x] All code paths use canonical shared types and Zod validation.
- [x] No legacy leaderboard logic remains in frontend.
