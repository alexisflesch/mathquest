## âœ… COMPLETED: New Scoring Strategy Implementation

### [COMPLETED] New Balanced Scoring Strategy
**Objective**: Implement new scoring strategy from scoring-todo.md with balanced multiple choice scoring, game scaling to 1000 points, and logarithmic time penalty.

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Game Scaling**: Total game scales to exactly 1000 points across all questions
- **Balanced Multiple Choice**: raw_score = max(0, (C_B / B) - (C_M / M)) where C_B=correct selected, B=total correct, C_M=incorrect selected, M=total incorrect  
- **Logarithmic Time Penalty**: time_penalty_factor = min(1, log(t + 1) / log(T + 1)), final_score = base_score Ã— (1 - Î± Ã— time_penalty_factor) with Î±=0.3
- **Redis-Only Architecture**: Uses mathquest:timer:{accessCode}:{questionUid} for duration data, mathquest:game:{accessCode} for question count

**Status**: âœ… FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

## ï¿½ NEXT: Email Verification Implementation

### [PLANNED] Email Verification System with Brevo
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive email verification for user registration and password reset using Brevo email service.

**Key Features to Implement**:
- **Registration Verification**: Email verification tokens sent during user registration
- **Password Reset Flow**: Secure password reset via email verification  
- **Brevo Integration**: Professional email service with domain-based sending
- **Security Features**: Cryptographic tokens, rate limiting, HTTPS-only links
- **User Experience**: Clear verification flows, resend options, mobile-friendly templates

**Implementation Paths**:
1. **User Registration Flow**: Send verification email â†’ user clicks link â†’ account activated
2. **Password Reset Flow**: Request reset â†’ email with secure link â†’ new password setup

**Status**: ï¿½ PHASE 1 IN PROGRESS
**Plan Document**: [`email-verification-implementation-plan.md`](./email-verification-implementation-plan.md)
**Estimated Duration**: 4 weeks
**Date Started**: 2025-08-31

**Phase 1 Progress (Week 1)**:
- [x] Database schema updated with email verification fields
- [x] Brevo SDK installed and configured  
- [x] Environment variables set up for email service
- [x] EmailService class implemented with Brevo integration
- [x] Email templates created (verification, password reset, welcome)
- [x] UserService enhancements for email verification
- [x] Database migration script created and run
- [x] Unit tests for EmailService
- [x] API endpoints for email verification
- [x] Unit tests for UserService email verification methods
- [x] Updated password reset to use email service
- [x] Shared types and schemas for email verification API

**Timeline Overview**:
- **Week 1**: Database schema updates, email service infrastructure, templates
- **Week 2**: Backend API implementation, verification endpoints, security middleware  
- **Week 3**: Frontend integration, UI components, user experience flows
- **Week 4**: Testing, documentation, security audit, deployment preparation

## ï¿½ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BUG FIXES

### [x] Scoring Strategy Implementation Issues
**Issue**: Two critical bugs causing integration test failures
**Root Causes**: 
1. **Participant Data Bug**: In scoringService.ts, wasn't creating initial Redis participant data when not found
2. **Timer Expiration Bug**: In canonicalTimerService.ts, timeLeftMs was being reset to full duration instead of 0 when timer expires
**Fixes**: 
1. Changed participant update logic to create initial data if not exists instead of only updating existing data
2. Changed timer expiration logic to set timeLeftMs = 0 instead of canonicalDurationMs when timer expires due to timeout
**Status**: âœ… FIXED
**Date**: 2025-08-30

### [x] Logout Hook Error Fix
**Issue**: "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" error when using "DÃ©connexion" button
**Root Cause**: In `frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`, there was a conditional return before all hooks were called. When userState changed from authenticated to anonymous after logout, React detected different hook counts between renders.
**Fix**: Moved the `useEffect` hook that maps `simpleMode` to `authMode` to be called before the conditional return statement.
**Status**: âœ… FIXED
**Date**: 2025-08-05

## Current Status

### New Scoring Strategy - COMPLETE âœ…
- **Implementation**: Fully implemented with async calculateAnswerScore function in scoringService.ts
- **Testing**: All 6 unit tests passing, all 10 integration tests passing, 9 tournament mode logic tests passing
- **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation in docs/features/new-scoring-strategy.md
- **Game Mode Coverage**: Works for Quiz mode, Live tournaments, and Deferred tournaments
- **Redis Optimization**: Uses Redis-only data sources for performance
- **Bug-Free**: All critical bugs fixed, scoring calculations working correctly

### Email Verification System - PLANNED ðŸ“‹
- **Analysis**: Current authentication system analyzed, gaps identified
- **Planning**: Comprehensive 4-week implementation plan created
- **Infrastructure**: Brevo email service selected, environment variables planned
- **Security**: Token-based verification, rate limiting, HTTPS-only links planned
- **User Experience**: Verification flows, resend options, mobile templates planned

### Test Coverage Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 6/6 passing - Pure scoring calculation logic
- **Integration Tests**: 10/10 passing - Full database and Redis setup
- **Tournament Mode Tests**: 9/9 passing - Logic verification for game mode differences
- **Total**: 25/25 tests passing âœ…
