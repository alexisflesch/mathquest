- [ ] `scripts/extract-socket-events.py` - Extract hardcoded socket events
- [ ] `scripts/fix-react-performance.py` - Add missing React hooks
- [ ] `scripts/bundle-optimization.py` - Implement code splitting suggestions

## Phase 8: ÔøΩ IMMEDIATE - Critical Environment Fixes
- [x] **Fix missing REDIS_URL configuration** - Recreate .env file from example.env
- [ ] Check for other missing environment variables
- [ ] Verify database connectivity 
- [ ] Test Redis connection

## Phase 9: ÔøΩüìã PLANNED - Final Validation & Testing

- [ ] Test all modernized components and pages
- [ ] Verify socket connections and event handling
- [ ] Validate API endpoints with proper type checking
- [ ] Performance testing of modernized codebase
- [ ] Update documentation with final architecture

## Phase 11: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Server-Side Scoring Security Fix
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - ALL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

**Issue**: Major security vulnerability - Backend trusts frontend for time calculations in scoring
- Frontend sends `timeSpent` directly in answer payload
- Backend uses this value for scoring without validation
- Users can manipulate scores by sending fake timeSpent values

**Root Cause**: Client-side time tracking passed to server-side scoring algorithm

**Solution**: Implement server-side time tracking service
- [x] **Create `TimingService` for server-side question timing**
  - [x] Track when users first see each question 
  - [x] Calculate actual time spent server-side
  - [x] Store timing data securely in Redis
- [x] **Update scoring algorithm to use server-calculated time**
  - [x] Remove `timeSpent` from client payload dependency
  - [x] Use `serverTimeSpent` from TimingService
  - [x] Add proper validation and logging
- [x] **Fix answer submission handlers**
  - [x] Update sharedLiveHandler.ts to use TimingService (not used for tournaments)
  - [x] Update gameAnswer.ts handler with server-side timing and scoring
  - [x] Add timing to question broadcast points in sharedGameFlow.ts
- [x] **Test scoring integrity - VERIFIED WORKING**
  - [x] Server-side timing working: 1854ms calculated correctly
  - [x] Score calculation working: 982 points (1000 base - 18 time penalty)
  - [x] Database persistence working: participant score updated correctly
- [x] **‚úÖ FIXED LEADERBOARD CALCULATION AND PERSISTENCE**
  - [x] Added Redis-database synchronization for participant scores
  - [x] Leaderboard now shows correct scores (982 points) instead of null/0
  - [x] Added leaderboard persistence to database when game ends
  - [x] Verified database storage: `[{"score":983,"userId":"...","username":"guest-68fbddc9","avatarEmoji":"üêº"}]`
  - [x] Complete end-to-end functionality restored

**Security Impact**: HIGH - Server-side scoring COMPLETE and tamper-proof
**Status**: FULLY OPERATIONAL - Scoring system now secure, functional, and persistent

**Verification Evidence (Tournament 3254)**:
- TimingService: `serverTimeSpent: 1854ms` ‚úÖ
- Scoring: `score: 982` (correct answer with time penalty) ‚úÖ  
- Database: `newScore: 982, scoreAdded: 982` ‚úÖ
- Redis sync: `Redis participant score synchronized` ‚úÖ
- Leaderboard: `"score": 982` displayed correctly ‚úÖ

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/services/timingService.ts` - NEW: Server-side timing service
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/sharedScore.ts` - Fixed scoring algorithm
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/game/gameAnswer.ts` - Added server timing, scoring, and Redis sync
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/sharedGameFlow.ts` - Question timing tracking
- `backend/src/utils/logger.ts` - Enhanced winston logging for debugging

## Phase 10: üö® CRITICAL - Tournament/Quiz Lobby Redirect Bug
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS

**Issue**: Backend sends conflicting events for tournament/quiz start logic
- Tournament lobbies: Backend sends immediate redirect + 5s countdown (should only be countdown)
- Quiz lobbies: Should send immediate redirect when teacher starts quiz (currently uses tournament flow)

**Current Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix tournament mode: Remove immediate redirect, keep only 5s countdown
- [ ] Fix quiz mode: Send immediate redirect from teacher dashboard when setting first question
- [ ] Update frontend lobby to handle quiz vs tournament modes differently
- [ ] Test both flows to ensure correct redirect timing

**Technical Details**:
- Tournament mode: Use only countdown events (`tournament_starting`, `countdown_tick`, `countdown_complete`)
- Quiz mode: Trigger redirect via `LOBBY_EVENTS.GAME_STARTED` when teacher sets first question and status changes from pending‚Üíactive
- Frontend: `isQuizLinked` flag determines if lobby shows start button (false for quiz mode)

**Files Being Modified**:
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/tournamentHandler.ts` - Split quiz vs tournament logic
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/teacherControl/setQuestion.ts` - Add quiz redirect trigger
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/lobbyHandler.ts` - Add quiz mode flag to participants list
- `frontend/src/app/lobby/[code]/page.tsx` - Handle immediate redirect for quiz mode

## üîç Current Focus: Phase 6 - TypeScript Error Resolution

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Fix projection hook interface** - Update return type to match ExtendedQuizState
2. **Fix projection page property access** - Update to use correct property names
3. **Fix other files using old event names** - Update useUnifiedGameManager
4. **Test complete flow** - Ensure projection page works end-to-end

### Technical Debt Identified:
- Multiple similar handler files (projection vs projector) - ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- Inconsistent room naming patterns - ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
- Mixed type usage in projection components - üîÑ IN PROGRESS
