# VERY IMPORTANT
app code is **read-only** except for test files. You are **not** to modify backend code, frontend code or shared code.

# Plan for today

1. Go through the entire app codebase and understand how it works. Especially read the doc under vuepress/ to understand what the app is supposed to do.

2. Read all test and create new backend/frontend test for features that are not covered yet.

3. If at some point you think you found a bug, document it, don't fix it.

4. Once you're done, try and find edge cases that may cause bugs. Document them too. Then write tests for them.
