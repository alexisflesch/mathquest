## Phase 10: 🚧 CRITICAL - Implement Missing Teacher Dashboard Socket Actions
**Root Cause**: Trophy and bar graph buttons exist in UI but are **not connected** to any socket events.

**Current State Analysis**:
- ✅ **UI Elements**: Trophy and ChartBarBig buttons exist in `QuestionDisplay.tsx`
- ✅ **Component Props**: `DraggableQuestionsList` accepts `onShowResults` and `onStatsToggle` props
- ❌ **Dashboard Integration**: Teacher dashboard page **NOT** passing these handlers to `DraggableQuestionsList`
- ✅ **Existing Events**: `correct_answers` and `dashboard_answer_stats_update` events already defined
- ✅ **Backend Handlers**: Some `correct_answers` emission exists in game flow handlers

**Required Implementation**:

### 1. Trophy Button (Show Results & Close Question)
- [x] **Frontend**: Add `handleShowResults(questionUid)` handler in teacher dashboard
- [x] **Socket Event**: Create teacher-triggered `show_correct_answers` event  
- [x] **Backend**: Implement handler to emit `correct_answers` to students + projection room
- [x] **Projection**: Update hook to handle `projection_correct_answers` events
- [x] **Types**: Add strongly typed `ShowCorrectAnswersPayload` with `questionUid` and teacher authorization

### 2. Bar Graph Button (Toggle Stats Display)  
- [x] **Frontend**: Add `handleStatsToggle(questionUid, show)` handler in teacher dashboard
- [x] **Socket Event**: Create `toggle_projection_stats` event for projection room
- [x] **Backend**: Implement handler to toggle stats visibility on projection page
- [x] **Projection**: Update hook to handle `projection_show_stats`/`projection_hide_stats` events
- [x] **Types**: Add strongly typed `ToggleProjectionStatsPayload` with `questionUid`, `show: boolean`, and stats data

### 3. Shared Types & Validation
- [x] **Payload Types**: Add `ShowCorrectAnswersPayload` and `ToggleProjectionStatsPayload` to shared types
- [ ] **Zod Schemas**: Add validation schemas for both payloads  
- [x] **Event Constants**: Add new events to `SOCKET_EVENTS.TEACHER` and `SOCKET_EVENTS.PROJECTOR`
- [ ] **Backend Validation**: Use Zod to validate incoming teacher requests

### 4. Frontend Integration
- [x] **Dashboard**: Connect handlers to DraggableQuestionsList component
- [x] **Projection Hook**: Add state and event listeners for new projection features
- [ ] **Projection UI**: Update projection page to display stats and correct answers

**Current Status**: ✅ Backend handlers, frontend handlers, and socket events fully implemented. Need UI components and validation.

**Exit Criteria**: Trophy and bar graph buttons fully functional with real-time projection updates.

## Phase 11: ✅ COMPLETED - Server-Side Scoring Security Fix
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - ALL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

**Issue**: Major security vulnerability - Backend trusts frontend for time calculations in scoring
- Frontend sends `timeSpent` directly in answer payload
- Backend uses this value for scoring without validation
- Users can manipulate scores by sending fake timeSpent values

**Root Cause**: Client-side time tracking passed to server-side scoring algorithm

**Solution**: Implement server-side time tracking service
- [x] **Create `TimingService` for server-side question timing**
  - [x] Track when users first see each question 
  - [x] Calculate actual time spent server-side
  - [x] Store timing data securely in Redis
- [x] **Update scoring algorithm to use server-calculated time**
  - [x] Remove `timeSpent` from client payload dependency
  - [x] Use `serverTimeSpent` from TimingService
  - [x] Add proper validation and logging
- [x] **Fix answer submission handlers**
  - [x] Update sharedLiveHandler.ts to use TimingService (not used for tournaments)
  - [x] Update gameAnswer.ts handler with server-side timing and scoring
  - [x] Add timing to question broadcast points in sharedGameFlow.ts
- [x] **Test scoring integrity - VERIFIED WORKING**
  - [x] Server-side timing working: 1854ms calculated correctly
  - [x] Score calculation working: 982 points (1000 base - 18 time penalty)
  - [x] Database persistence working: participant score updated correctly
- [x] **✅ FIXED LEADERBOARD CALCULATION AND PERSISTENCE**
  - [x] Added Redis-database synchronization for participant scores
  - [x] Leaderboard now shows correct scores (982 points) instead of null/0
  - [x] Added leaderboard persistence to database when game ends
  - [x] Verified database storage: `[{"score":983,"userId":"...","username":"guest-68fbddc9","avatarEmoji":"🐼"}]`
  - [x] Complete end-to-end functionality restored

**Security Impact**: HIGH - Server-side scoring COMPLETE and tamper-proof
**Status**: FULLY OPERATIONAL - Scoring system now secure, functional, and persistent

**Verification Evidence (Tournament 3254)**:
- TimingService: `serverTimeSpent: 1854ms` ✅
- Scoring: `score: 982` (correct answer with time penalty) ✅  
- Database: `newScore: 982, scoreAdded: 982` ✅
- Redis sync: `Redis participant score synchronized` ✅
- Leaderboard: `"score": 982` displayed correctly ✅

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/services/timingService.ts` - NEW: Server-side timing service
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/sharedScore.ts` - Fixed scoring algorithm
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/game/gameAnswer.ts` - Added server timing, scoring, and Redis sync
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/sharedGameFlow.ts` - Question timing tracking
- `backend/src/utils/logger.ts` - Enhanced winston logging for debugging

## Phase 10: 🚨 CRITICAL - Tournament/Quiz Lobby Redirect Bug
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Issue**: Backend sends conflicting events for tournament/quiz start logic
- Tournament lobbies: Backend sends immediate redirect + 5s countdown (should only be countdown)
- Quiz lobbies: Should send immediate redirect when teacher starts quiz (currently uses tournament flow)

**Current Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix tournament mode: Remove immediate redirect, keep only 5s countdown
- [ ] Fix quiz mode: Send immediate redirect from teacher dashboard when setting first question
- [ ] Update frontend lobby to handle quiz vs tournament modes differently
- [ ] Test both flows to ensure correct redirect timing

**Technical Details**:
- Tournament mode: Use only countdown events (`tournament_starting`, `countdown_tick`, `countdown_complete`)
- Quiz mode: Trigger redirect via `LOBBY_EVENTS.GAME_STARTED` when teacher sets first question and status changes from pending→active
- Frontend: `isQuizLinked` flag determines if lobby shows start button (false for quiz mode)

**Files Being Modified**:
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/tournamentHandler.ts` - Split quiz vs tournament logic
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/teacherControl/setQuestion.ts` - Add quiz redirect trigger
- `backend/src/sockets/handlers/lobbyHandler.ts` - Add quiz mode flag to participants list
- `frontend/src/app/lobby/[code]/page.tsx` - Handle immediate redirect for quiz mode

---

## Phase 12: ✅ COMPLETED - Tournament Ending Database Update Fix
- [x] **Fix tournament ending database fields update**
  - [x] Update sharedGameFlow.ts to set status="completed" when tournament completes (following strict naming)
  - [x] Set endedAt to current timestamp
  - [x] Set isDiffered=true to enable deferred mode access
  - [x] Set differedAvailableFrom to same timestamp as endedAt
  - [x] Set differedAvailableTo to endedAt + 7 days
  - [x] Test tournament completion flow to verify database updates
  - [x] Verify deferred mode availability window is correctly set

**Issue**: Tournament ending only persisted leaderboard but didn't update status/timing fields
**Impact**: HIGH - Affects tournament lifecycle and deferred mode availability
**Resolution**: Fixed database updates in `backend/src/sockets/handlers/sharedGameFlow.ts`
**Status**: COMPLETE - Tournaments now properly transition to completed status with 7-day deferred window

---

## Current Phase: Tournament Flow Bug Fixes

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Fix tournament ending - update database fields (status, endedAt, differedAvailableFrom, differedAvailableTo)

### 🔄 Current Tasks  
- [ ] Fix deferred tournament access - allow joining ended tournaments for async play
  - [ ] Investigate where "Code erroné (status: ended)" error is coming from
  - [ ] Update backend logic to allow joining ended tournaments if within deferred window

# Plan: Remove Offline Participants from Lobby

## Problem
Disconnected users remain in the lobby participant list as "offline", causing the lobby to appear populated by users who are no longer present.

## Goals
- Ensure the lobby only displays currently connected (online) users.
- Remove participant objects from Redis and backend state when users disconnect.

## Steps

1. **Audit Current Disconnect Handling**
   - Review the code that handles socket disconnects and participant cleanup.
   - Identify where participants are marked as offline but not removed.

2. **Update Disconnect Logic**
   - Modify the disconnect handler to remove participant objects from Redis and backend state when a user disconnects.
   - Ensure this does not interfere with game state if the user is in an active game.

3. **Update Lobby Participant Query**
   - Ensure any code that fetches the lobby participant list only includes users with `online: true`.

4. **Test Cases**
   - User joins and leaves lobby: should be removed from the list.
   - Multiple users join/leave: only online users are shown.
   - User disconnects during a game: ensure correct handling (may differ from lobby).

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Add logs for participant removal events.
   - Monitor for unexpected removals or errors.

6. **Deployment and Verification**
   - Deploy changes to staging.
   - Verify with manual and automated tests.

  - Files: `useEnhancedStudentGameSocket.ts`, `useGameSocket.ts`, `usePracticeSession.ts`
  - **Security Risk**: Unvalidated socket payloads can cause runtime errors or injection attacks
  - **Action Required**: Import and implement Zod schemas from `@shared/types/socketEvents.zod`

#### Non-Shared Payload Types (106 emitters)  
- [ ] **Socket emitters not using canonical shared types**
  - **Violation**: Direct breach of `.instructions.md` "USE shared types" mandate
  - **Impact**: Type inconsistencies between frontend/backend socket communication
  - **Action Required**: Replace local type definitions with shared type imports

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

#### Hardcoded Event Names (158 occurrences)
- [ ] **Replace hardcoded socket event strings with constants**
  - **Risk**: Typos causing silent socket communication failures
  - **Action Required**: Import `SOCKET_EVENTS` from `@shared/types/socket/events`

#### Missing Type Guards (15 handlers)
- [ ] **Add runtime type validation to socket handlers**
  - **Files**: Practice session and connection handlers primarily affected
  - **Action Required**: Implement type guard functions for payload validation

### 📊 VALIDATION COVERAGE GAPS

#### Documentation Issues (52 handlers)
