# Timer Flickering Fix - Hook Optimization Solution ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETED, PHASE 2 IN PROGRESS

## Problem Analysis
The draggable timer in `TeacherProjectionClient.tsx` was flickering during drag operations due to:
- Hook updating `timeLeftMs` every **100ms** (projection update interval)
- Timer display only changing every **second** (`Math.floor(timeLeftMs / 1000)`)
- This caused **10 unnecessary hook re-executions per second** with the same visual output
- Even with optimized timer values, the hook was returning new objects every 100ms

## Phase 1: Hook Optimization ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Fixed at the hook level with comprehensive timer optimization:
1. **Optimized timer value updates**: Only update `optimizedTimeLeftMs` when displayed seconds value actually changes
2. **Optimized timer status updates**: Only update `optimizedTimerStatus` when status actually changes
3. **Memoized hook return value**: Used `useMemo` to prevent new object creation when only timer internals change
4. **Proper dependency management**: Only re-execute when values that affect the display actually change
5. **Stable object references**: Used `EMPTY_STATS` and `EMPTY_LEADERBOARD` constants to prevent new object creation

### Phase 1 Results ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Reduced console spam from timer hook (90% improvement)
- ‚úÖ Hook only re-executes when meaningful display values change
- ‚ùå **Still experiencing flickering more than once per second**

## Phase 2: Render Investigation üîÑ IN PROGRESS
Issue: Component still re-renders frequently despite hook optimization
Goal: Identify what's causing the frequent re-renders beyond the timer

### Phase 2 Changes Made
- [x] Created `useRenderTracker` hook to monitor component re-renders and prop changes
- [x] Created `useDependencyTracker` hook to monitor hook dependency changes
- [x] Added render tracking to `TeacherProjectionClient` component
- [x] Added dependency tracking to `useProjectionQuizSocket` useMemo
- [ ] **TESTING**: Run application and analyze render logs to identify root cause
- [ ] Fix identified cause of frequent re-renders
- [ ] Verify drag/resize operations work without flickering

### Phase 2 Testing
To test the render tracking:
1. Start the frontend development server
2. Navigate to a teacher projection page with an active timer
3. Check console for render tracking logs:
   - `üé≠ [RENDER TRACKER] TeacherProjectionClient re-render` - Shows what props changed
   - `üîç [DEPENDENCY TRACKER] useProjectionQuizSocket.useMemo dependencies changed` - Shows which dependencies triggered useMemo
4. Look for patterns - what's changing more than once per second?
5. Drag the timer element and see what renders during drag operations

## Expected Phase 2 Outcome
- Identify the exact cause of frequent re-renders (likely object reference issues)
- Implement targeted fix for the root cause
- Achieve smooth drag/resize operations without flickering
- Component only re-renders when display actually needs to change

## Technical Details
The fix specifically addresses the timer update frequency by:
- Extracting current timer values to avoid dependencies on entire timer object
- Using refs to track previous values and only update when necessary
- Implementing proper change detection for both time and status
- Using `useMemo` with precise dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Adding comprehensive debugging to track render causes
