## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BUG FIXES

### [x] Logout Hook Error Fix
**Issue**: "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" error when using "DÃ©connexion" button
**Root Cause**: In `frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`, there was a conditional return before all hooks were called. When userState changed from authenticated to anonymous after logout, React detected different hook counts between renders.
**Fix**: Moved the `useEffect` hook that maps `simpleMode` to `authMode` to be called before the conditional return statement.
**Status**: âœ… FIXED
**Date**: 2025-08-05

## Current Status
- All hooks in login page are now called before any conditional returns
- Authentication flow remains intact
- Error should no longer occur when logging out

## Next Steps
1. Test logout functionality to confirm fix
2. Monitor for any other similar hook ordering issues in other components
