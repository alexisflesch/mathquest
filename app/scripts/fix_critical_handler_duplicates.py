Critical Handler Duplicates Fix Script

Following .instructions.md requirements:
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- Use scripts instead of manual edits
- Document everything
- Zero tolerance for legacy patterns

This script addresses the most critical duplicate handler registrations
that could cause functional bugs or security issues.
