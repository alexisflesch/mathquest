/**
 * Migration Test Suite Index
 * 
 * Comprehensive integration tests for all migration wrapper functions.
 * These tests verify that the migration layer provides seamless backward
 * compatibility while correctly routing to the appropriate backend systems.
 * 
 * Test Coverage:
 * - useTeacherQuizSocketMigrated: Teacher dashboard migration
 * - useProjectionQuizSocketMigrated: Projector view migration  
 * - useStudentGameSocketMigrated: Student game participation migration
 * - useTournamentSocketMigrated: Tournament-specific migration
 * 
 * Test Areas:
 * 1. Backend Detection and Routing
 * 2. State Mapping and Transformation
 * 3. Method Delegation
 * 4. Timer Synchronization
 * 5. Error Handling
 * 6. Memory Management
 * 7. Backward Compatibility
