## Teacher Dashboard Socket Configuration Modernization

### Changes Made âœ…

1. **Removed Hardcoded Socket URL**
   - Before: `'http://localhost:3001'` (hardcoded)
   - After: `SOCKET_CONFIG.url` (environment-aware config)

2. **Replaced Hardcoded Event Names with Shared Constants**
   - `'join_teacher_dashboard'` â†’ `SOCKET_EVENTS.TEACHER.JOIN_DASHBOARD`
   - `'dashboard_state'` â†’ `SOCKET_EVENTS.TEACHER.GAME_CONTROL_STATE` 
   - `'game_control_state'` â†’ removed (duplicate)
   - `'connected_count_update'` â†’ `'quiz_connected_count'` (matches backend)
   - `'connect_error'` â†’ `SOCKET_EVENTS.CONNECT_ERROR`
   - `'end_quiz'` â†’ `SOCKET_EVENTS.TEACHER.END_GAME`

3. **Socket Configuration Pattern**
   - Uses canonical `SOCKET_CONFIG` with proper timing, credentials, transports
   - Environment-aware URL (localhost:3007 dev, production URL)
   - Proper imports from `@/config` and `@shared/types/socket/events`

### Files Modified âœ…
- `/frontend/src/app/teacher/dashboard/[code]/page.tsx`
- `/log.md` (documented changes)
- `/plan.md` (updated phase completion)

### Next Steps for Testing ðŸ§ª

1. **Test Socket Connection**
   - Should now connect to `http://localhost:3007` (from config) instead of hardcoded `:3001`
   - Check browser console for successful connection

2. **Test Event Flow**
   - Dashboard should emit `join_dashboard` (not `join_teacher_dashboard`)
   - Should receive `game_control_state` with game data
   - Should receive `quiz_connected_count` with participant count

3. **Verify Backend Compatibility**
   - Backend expects `join_dashboard` event (confirmed)
   - Backend emits `game_control_state` and `quiz_connected_count` (confirmed)

### Error Resolution ðŸ”§
The original WebSocket error was connecting to `:3001` but the config uses `:3007`. This change should resolve the connection failure.
