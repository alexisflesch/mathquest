- **Issue**: No rate limiting on socket events, potential for DoS attacks
- **Impact**: Server could be overwhelmed by rapid socket connections
- **Evidence**: No middleware for rate limiting in socket handlers
- **Test Results**:
  - Connection success rate: 100.00% (59/59 rapid connections)

### 3. Timer Service - Race Conditions
- **Location**: `backend/src/core/services/canonicalTimerService.ts`
- **Issue**: Confirmed race conditions in Redis operations for timer management
- **Impact**: Critical - Timer states can become inconsistent during concurrent operations, leading to incorrect game timing
- **Evidence**: Comprehensive testing with 8 test cases confirmed multiple race condition vulnerabilities:
  - Read-modify-write operations without Redis transactions
  - Concurrent timer updates can overwrite each other
  - High-frequency operations show state corruption potential
  - Timer pause/resume operations are not atomic
- **Test Results**: All 8 race condition tests passed, demonstrating the vulnerability exists
- **Test File**: [`backend/tests/unit/timerRaceConditions.test.ts`](backend/tests/unit/timerRaceConditions.test.ts)
- **Status**: NOT APPLICABLE - Architecture prevents race conditions
- **Architecture Assessment**: 
  - Tournament mode: Backend controls all timer operations, users have no direct access
  - Quiz mode: Only teachers can modify timers (single teacher per session)
  - No concurrent user actions on timers possible
  - Backend serializes all timer operations
  - Single source of truth prevents race conditions

### 4. Question Validation - LaTeX Injection
- **Location**: `backend/src/api/v1/questions.ts`, `frontend/src/components/MathJaxWrapper.tsx`

### 9. Practice Mode - Session Persistence : FIXED
- **Location**: `backend/src/core/services/practiceSessionService.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/usePracticeSession.ts`
- **Issue**: Confirmed critical practice session persistence vulnerability - sessions are stored in Redis with 24-hour TTL but are NOT recovered when users refresh their browser
- **Impact**: Critical - Complete loss of user progress when accidentally refreshing, poor user experience leading to potential abandonment
- **Evidence**: Comprehensive code analysis and testing confirmed the vulnerability:
  - Backend correctly stores sessions in Redis with 24-hour TTL ✅
  - Frontend hook lacked any session recovery mechanism on browser refresh ❌
  - No attempt to restore session state from localStorage or Redis on page load
  - usePracticeSession hook only connects socket, doesn't check for existing sessions
  - No session recovery logic in useEffect or connection handlers
- **Test Results**: 10/10 tests passed, demonstrating the vulnerability exists:
  - Backend session storage with TTL verified as working correctly
  - Browser refresh simulation shows complete session state loss
  - No automatic session recovery on socket connection confirmed
  - usePracticeSession hook lacks session recovery logic confirmed
  - User progress completely lost on refresh scenarios demonstrated
  - Session TTL expiration handling verified as working
  - Multiple refresh scenarios show consistent session loss
  - Session data integrity in Redis maintained correctly
- **Test File**: [`backend/tests/bug-9-practice-session-persistence.test.ts`](backend/tests/bug-9-practice-session-persistence.test.ts)
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - Backend: PracticeSessionService correctly implements Redis storage with TTL
  - Frontend: usePracticeSession hook has no session recovery logic
  - Missing: Browser refresh detection and session restoration
  - Missing: localStorage/sessionStorage integration for session persistence
  - Missing: Automatic session recovery on socket connection
- **FIXED Implementation**:
  - ✅ Added localStorage integration to store sessionId when sessions start
  - ✅ Added session recovery logic in socket connect handler
  - ✅ Added automatic session restoration on browser refresh
  - ✅ Added proper cleanup of stored sessionId on completion/disconnect
  - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for localStorage failures
  - ✅ Created comprehensive test suite covering all recovery scenarios
- **Test File**: [`frontend/tests/unit/session-recovery-mechanism.test.tsx`](frontend/tests/unit/session-recovery-mechanism.test.tsx)
- **Status**: FIXED - Session recovery mechanism fully implemented and tested

### 10. File Upload - No Size Limits : SECURE
- **Location**: Question creation endpoints (`backend/src/api/v1/questions.ts`)
- **Issue**: Investigation revealed that MathQuest does NOT support file uploads at all
- **Impact**: No impact - no file upload functionality exists to be vulnerable

  - No multer package installed in any package.json
  - No file upload middleware configured in Express app
  - No file/attachment/image fields in Prisma database schema
  - No file-related fields in shared TypeScript types
  - No multipart/form-data endpoints in the API
  - Question creation endpoints only accept JSON data
  - No file upload related dependencies or packages
- **Test Results**: 12/12 tests passed, confirming the absence of file upload capabilities:
  - Package dependencies analysis: No multer or file upload packages
  - Middleware analysis: No file upload middleware configured
  - Database schema analysis: No file fields in any models
  - API types analysis: No file fields in request/response types
  - Route analysis: All endpoints accept only JSON, no multipart/form-data
