# API Response Type Safety Sweep â€” Summary & Next Steps

## Objective
Ensure that all API responses (REST endpoints, not sockets) are:
- **Strongly typed** using TypeScript interfaces/types.
- **Shared** between backend and frontend (imported from a `shared` directory).
- **Validated** at runtime (e.g., with Zod or similar) where appropriate.

---

## Recommended Steps

### 1. Backend
- **Audit all API controllers/handlers** (e.g., in `backend/src/api/`, `backend/src/routes/`, etc.).
- For each endpoint:
  - Ensure the response payload is typed with a shared type (from `shared/types/apiResponses.ts` or similar).
  - If a type does not exist, define it in the shared types and use it in both backend and frontend.
  - Add runtime validation (e.g., Zod) for outgoing responses if not already present.

### 2. Frontend
- **Audit all API calls** (e.g., in `frontend/src/api/`, `frontend/src/services/`, `frontend/src/hooks/`, etc.).
- For each API call:
  - Ensure the expected response is typed with the same shared type as the backend.
  - Use runtime validation (e.g., Zod) to parse/validate responses before using them in the app.

### 3. Shared Types
- **Centralize all API response types** in a shared directory (e.g., `shared/types/apiResponses.ts`).
- Ensure both backend and frontend import from this shared location.

### 4. Testing
- Run TypeScript checks (`npx tsc`) to ensure type safety.
- Optionally, add integration tests to verify that API responses match the shared types.

## Impact
- Prevents backend/frontend contract drift.
- Catches bugs at compile time, not runtime.
- Makes refactoring and onboarding easier.

---

## Next Session
- Resume with a sweep of backend API handlers, then frontend API consumers, following the above plan.
- Define and enforce shared types for all API responses.

**You are now ready to enforce strong, shared typing for all API responses across
