**Phase 3: Shared Constants & Cleanup**

## June 13, 2025

### ðŸ“‹ Session Start
**Time**: Session initiated
**Goal**: Begin Phase 3 - Shared Constants & Cleanup
**Context**: Phase 2 completed successfully with all TypeScript errors resolved and field naming consistency achieved

**Actions Taken**:
1. Created `plan.md` with Phase 3 checklist and tasks
2. Created `log.md` to track all changes (this file)

**Next**: Start with 3A - Question Type Constants analysis and implementation

### âš¡ 3A: Question Type Constants Analysis & Fix
**Time**: Analysis completed
**Issue Found**: The existing `/shared/constants/questionTypes.ts` file violated modernization principles by creating new English constants and migration mappings

**Root Cause**: The constants file was attempting to introduce new standardized types rather than using the canonical types already in the system

**Analysis Results**:
- **French types are canonical**: `choix_simple`, `choix_multiple` (most widely used, used as defaults)
- **English types are secondary**: `multiple_choice`, `multiple_choice_single_answer` (used in some tests)
- **Mixed usage throughout codebase**: 67+ hard-coded occurrences need standardization

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Fixed `/shared/constants/questionTypes.ts`**:
   - Removed the LEGACY_QUESTION_TYPE_MAPPING (violates "no migration layers" principle)
   - Changed QUESTION_TYPES to use actual canonical values from the system
   - Updated SINGLE_CHOICE to `'choix_simple'` (canonical)
   - Updated MULTIPLE_CHOICE to `'choix_multiple'` (canonical) 
   - Kept MULTIPLE_CHOICE_SINGLE_ANSWER as `'multiple_choice_single_answer'` (canonical)
   - Added MULTIPLE_CHOICE_EN as `'multiple_choice'` (alternative form)
   - Removed getCanonicalQuestionType() function (migration layer)
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

**Files Modified**:
- âœ… `/shared/constants/questionTypes.ts` - Fixed to use canonical types

**12:00 PM - Fixed TypeScript compilation error**
- **What**: Removed invalid export `getCanonicalQuestionType` from `shared/constants/index.ts`
- **Why**: Function was removed during constants cleanup but export reference remained
- **Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit --project shared/tsconfig.json` now passes cleanly
- **Files**: `shared/constants/index.ts`

**Next**: Update components to use constants instead of hard-coded strings
