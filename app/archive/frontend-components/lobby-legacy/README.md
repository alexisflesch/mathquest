# Lobby Page - Legacy Backup

## Date Archived: September 5, 2025

## Reason for Archival
The lobby page (`/src/app/lobby/[code]/page.tsx`) was identified as legacy/orphaned code. Analysis showed:

1. **No Navigation Links**: No components in the codebase link to `/lobby/*` routes
2. **No Direct References**: No `href="/lobby"` or `router.push("/lobby")` calls found
3. **Legacy Purpose**: The page was a tournament waiting room/lobby, but this functionality appears to have been replaced or is no longer used in the current application flow

## Original Location
- `/frontend/src/app/lobby/[code]/page.tsx`

## Functionality Overview
The lobby page was a tournament waiting room that:
- Showed participants joining a tournament
- Handled real-time updates via Socket.IO
- Managed countdown timers before tournament start
- Redirected to live tournament or leaderboard pages
- Had serious React Hooks violations (conditional hook calls)

## Technical Issues Found
- **React Hooks Violations**: Multiple `useCallback` and `useEffect` hooks called after conditional returns
- **Complex Socket Logic**: Heavy Socket.IO event handling
- **Authentication Dependencies**: Complex auth state management

## Files Backed Up
- `lobby/[code]/page.tsx` - Main lobby component
- `lobby/[code]/page.tsx.backup` - Previous backup version

## Recommendation
This code can be safely removed from the active codebase as it appears to be unused. If lobby functionality is needed in the future, this backup contains the full implementation.
